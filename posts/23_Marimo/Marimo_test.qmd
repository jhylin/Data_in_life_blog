This is a [Marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) notebook currently in test mode inside a Quarto blog. 

Few things to note so far after using the new [Quarto-Marimo extension](https://github.com/marimo-team/quarto-marimo):

1. Marimo version 0.13.3 works currently and likely not other newer versions (noted a few issues logged about this on the extension's GitHub repo when using more current versions; may still need to try versions 0.14.3 and/or 0.17.3)

2. This Quarto-Marimo integration works in a Quarto project such as a blog.

3. The reactivity of Marimo notebooks inside Quarto blog may take a few seconds to load.

<br>

Below are sample code from Marimo with my little adaptation for a test drive.

#### Just another Quarto project

```python {.marimo}
#| echo: true
import marimo as mo
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10, 1, label="Look, a slider!")
slider
```

<br>

When the slider is moved to the left or right, the word, "here!" will change accordingly.

<br>

#### More things

And we can respond!

```python {.marimo}
# No echo here means we do not show the code
mo.md("2026 is " + "here! " * slider.value)
```
<br>

I'll need to explore other things to try later in Marimo...!
