If we're thinking along the line mathematically or statistically to improve the model, we would then think about using the average of multiple models [@breiman1998] to see if this output would better reflect the real-life scenario. This model averaging approach was in fact constantly used in our lives with a common example such as using majority votes in elections or decision-making processes.\n\nThe same model averaging concept was also used in random forest [@breiman2001], which as the name suggested, was composed of many decision tree models forming a forest. To focus on each tree in the forest, each tree model would be making its own model prediction. By having multiple predictions since we have multiple trees, the average obtained from these predictions would produce one single result in the end. The advantage of this was that it improved the accuracy of the prediction by reducing variances, and also minimised the problem of overfitting the model if it was purely based on one model only (section 1.11.2.1. Random Forests from [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests-and-other-randomized-tree-ensembles) might help to explain this further).\n\nThe \"random\" part of the random forest was introduced in two ways. The first one was via using bootstrap samples, which was also known as bagging or bootstrap aggregating [@bruce2020], where samples were drawn with replacements within the training datasets for each tree built in the ensemble (the perturb-and-combine technique [@breiman1998]). While bootstrap sampling was happening, randomness was also incorporated at the same time into the training sets. The second way randomness was introduced was by using a random subset of features for splitting at the nodes, or a full set of features could also be used instead (although this was generally not recommended). The main goal was to achieve best splits at each node.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Random forest in *scikit-learn***\n\n*Scikit-learn* had two main types of random forest classes - [ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) and [ensemble.RandomForestRegressor()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor). When to use which method would depend on the target values. The easiest thing to do was to decide whether the target variables had class labels (binary types or non-continuous variables e.g. yes or no) or continuous variables, which in this case, if I were to continue using the same dataset from last series of blog posts, it would be a continuous variable or feature, pKi, the inhibition constant. \n\nThere were also two alternative random forest methods in *scikit-learn*, which were ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding() and ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier() or ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor(). The difference for RandomTreesEmbedding() was that it was an unsupervised method that used data transformations (details can be accessed from section 1.11.2.6. on \"Totally Random Trees Embedding\" in [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests-and-other-randomized-tree-ensembles)). I have not planned on using this unsupervised method in this post, but thought to mention it as it might be useful for others in other different ML scenarios. On the other side, there was also an option to use ExtraTreesClassifier() or ExtraTreesRegressor() to generate extremely randomised trees that would go for another level up in randomness (more deatils in section 1.11.2.2. on Extremely Randomized Trees from [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests-and-other-randomized-tree-ensembles)). The main difference for this type of random forest was that while there was already a random subset of feature selection used (with an intention to select the most discerning features), more randomness were added by using purely randomly generated splitting rules for picking features at the nodes.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Building a random forest regressor model using *scikit-learn***\n\nAs

attentions when I was doing data splits in the last series on decision tree, as my main focus was on building a single tree in order to fully understand and see what could be derived from just one tree. Now, when I reached this series on random forest, I realised I forgot to mention in the last series that data splitting was actually very crucial and impactful on model performance and also outcome predictions. It could also become quite complicated as more approaches were available to split the data, and the way the data was splitted could produce different outcomes. After I've splitted the same dataset based on compounds' max phase assignments and also fitted the training data on the random forest regressor, I went back and had another look, then noticed that, the training and testing data were very imbalanced, and perhaps I should do something to the data before fitting them onto the estimator. \n\nSo I started a simple online search, and after several quick online and also text book reads, I've decided that the likely plan for this series on random forest was to stick with max phase splits for now, since this was a regression problem (as I was trying to predict a continuous variable, inhibition constant, pKi, and not a binary label or outcome). Based on current common ML concensus (Google, StackOverflow, ML mastery examples), imbalanced dataset was more applicable to classification tasks (e.g. binary labels or multi-class labels), rather than regression problems. However, with more current ML researches looking into the issue of imbalanced datasets, there were actually findings using other strategies such as deep imbalanced regression for regression problems too (cite bookmarked paper, there might be more studies in this area as well).\n\n<br>\n\n###### **Preparing training data**\n\nSetting up X variable first via the dataframe, and converting it into a NumPy array X (no. of samples, no. of features), keeping it the same as how it was in the decision tree series.\n\nNote: It's usually a good practice to copy the original data or dataframe for further data manipulations to avoid any unnecessary changes to the original dataset (this was not used in the decision tree posts but since I'm going to use the same set of data again I'd better do this here.)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# X variables (molecular features)---\n# Make a copy of the original dataframe first\ndata_mp4 = data.copy()\n# Selecting all max phase 4 compounds\ndata_mp4 = data_mp4[data_mp4[\"max_phase\"] == 4]\nprint(data_mp4.shape)\ndata_mp4.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(10, 25)\n```\n:::\n\n:::

So this has confirmed that the model was indeed making predictions (rather than not making any at all, which meant there might be no point in finding out which features were important in the data, so it was a good checking point during the random forest model building exercise), therefore, we could proceed to the next step of generating some feature importances, which were useful information to fill in the bigger story i.e. which features were pivotal for influencing the pKi values of prescription drugs targeting AChE? \n\n*?optional - May need to add a mean squared error for y_mp4 & y_mp_test (= rfreg.predict(X_mp_test))*\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Feature importances**\n\nThere were two types of feature importances available in *scikit-learn*, which I've described below.\n\n<br>\n\n###### **feature_importances_ attribute from *scikit-learn***\n\nThe impurity-based feature importances (also known as Gini importance).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Compute feature importances on rfreg training model\nfeature_imp = rfreg.feature_importances_\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Check what feature_imp looks like (an array)\nfeature_imp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\narray([0.01845843, 0.0833086 , 0.00414526, 0.17344377, 0.02473391,\n       0.03119123, 0.03215709, 0.01706784, 0.        , 0.21772693,\n       0.03390372, 0.16184532, 0.07451324, 0.029626  , 0.00256679,\n       0.01350827, 0.02132237, 0.00666429, 0.02731864, 0.        ,\n       0.01323578, 0.01326253])\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Convert the feature_imp array into dataframe\nfeature_imp_df = pd.DataFrame(feature_imp)\n#feature_imp_df\n\n# Obtain feature names via column names of dataframe\n# Rename the index as \"features\"\nfeature = X_mp4_df.columns.rename(\"features\")\n\n# Convert the index to dataframe\nfeature_name_df = feature.to_frame(index = False)\n\n# Concatenate feature_imp_df & feature_name_df\nfeature_df = pd.concat([feature_imp_df, feature_name_df], axis=1)\n\n# Rename the column for feature importances\nfeature_df = feature_df.rename(columns = {0: \"feature_importances\"})\n\n# Sort values of feature importances in descending order\nfeature_df = feature_df.sort_values(\"feature_importances\", ascending=False)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Seaborn bar plot\nsns.barplot(feature_df, x = \"feature_importances\", y = \"features\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n```\n<AxesSubplot: xlabel='feature_importances', ylabel='features'>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](1_random_forest_files/figure-html/cell-17-output-2.png){width=732 height=429}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn alternative way to plot was via Matplotlib directly (note: Seaborn also uses Matplotlib as well, so the plots are pretty similar).

The impurity-based feature importances computed on tree-based models suffer from two flaws that can lead to misleading conclusions. First they are computed on statistics derived from the training dataset and therefore do not necessarily inform us on which features are most important to make good predictions on held-out dataset. Secondly, they favor high cardinality features, that is features with many unique values.

StackOverflow answer - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48244219/is-sklearn-metrics-mean-squared-error-the-larger-the-better-negated\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Matplotlib boxplots for each no. of tree model with average mean squared errors shown\nplt.boxplot(results, labels=names, showmeans=True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](1_random_forest_files/figure-html/cell-23-output-1.png){width=569 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Try Seaborn version too\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Show all scoring metrics - URL link: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter\n# sklearn.metrics.get_scorer_names() \n```\n:::\n\n\n*Might not actually code for the ones below (due to length of post), but they would be worth looking into if doing full-scale, comprehensive ML models using random forest:\n\n- tree depths (max_depth)\n\n- number of samples (max_samples) (probably won't do this as the training sample size was already very small to start with!)\n\n- number of features (max_features) (can mention using RDKit's version to generate molecular features which would provide 209)\n\n- nodes\n\n* Plots - Black-box ML e.g. if comparing clogp vs. pKi? (unlike white-box ML for decision tree) - or can mention that the feature importances section was necessary to shed some lights and remove some layers of the black-box style of random forest by showing which features were making impacts on the predictive models.\n\n* Other options available in Scikit-learn ensemble methods e.g. voting classifier/regressor or stacking models to reduce biases\n\n* Aim to keep post short and succinct!\n\n",
