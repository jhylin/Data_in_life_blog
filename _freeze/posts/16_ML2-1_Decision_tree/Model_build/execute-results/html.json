The details of all the steps taken to reach the final .csv file could be seen in these earlier **posts** (yes, it took quite a while to clean the data, so it was splitted into two posts).\n\n-   The final .csv file used to train the model was named, \"ache_2d_chembl.csv\"\n\n-   The earlier version without any RDKit 2D descriptors calculated was named, \"ache_chembl.csv\"\n\n-   Both files should be in a GitHub repository called, \"[ML2-1_decision_tree](https://github.com/jhylin/ML2-1_decision_tree)\" or in my [blog repository](https://github.com/jhylin/Data_in_life_blog), under \"posts\" folder (look for \"16_ML2-1_Decision_tree\" folder)\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Estimate experimental errors**\n\nThis part was about estimating the impact of experimental errors (pKi values) on the predictive machine learning (ML) models. It was also needed to estimate the maximum possible correlation that could be drawn from the dataset prepared from the previous two posts. I supposed it made more sense if this was done prior to building the ML model, so this wouldn't be forgotten or missed, as we know that real-life is full of many imperfections.\n\nThis subsection was inspired by Pat Walters' posts, which have discussed about estimating errors for experimental data with code links available in these posts:\n\n-   [How Good Could (Should) My Models Be?](http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-good-could-should-my-models-be.html) - a reference paper [@Brown2009] was mentioned as the simulation basis for estimating the impact of experimental errors on the correlation from a predictive ML model\n\n-   [Getting Real with Molecular Property Prediction](http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2023/06/getting-real-with-molecular-property.html) (under subsection of \"How Well Should We Be Able to Model the Data?\")\n\nTo get started, all the required libraries were loaded as below.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import tree\n```\n:::\n\n\nImported the preprocessed data from previous posts.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Import data\ndtree = pd.read_csv(\"ache_2d_chembl.csv\")\ndtree.drop(columns = [\"Unnamed: 0\"], inplace=True)\ndtree.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=26}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>molecule_chembl_id</th>\n      <th>pKi</th>\n      <th>max_phase</th>\n      <th>mw</th>\n      <th>fsp3</th>\n      <th>n_lipinski_hba</th>\n      <th>n_lipinski_hbd</th>\n      <th>n_rings</th>\n      <th>n_hetero_atoms</th>\n      <th>n_heavy_atoms</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>sas</th>\n      <th>n_aliphatic_carbocycles</th>\n      <th>n_aliphatic_heterocyles</th>\n      <th>n_aliphatic_rings</th>\n      <th>n_aromatic_carbocycles</th>\n      <th>n_aromatic_heterocyles</th>\n      <th>n_aromatic_rings</th>\n      <th>n_saturated_carbocycles</th>\n      <th>n_saturated_heterocyles</th>\n      <th>n_saturated_rings</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL60745</td>\n      <td>8.787812</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>245.041526</td>\n      <td>0.400000</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>3.185866</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL208599</td>\n      <td>10.585027</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>298.123676</td>\n      <td>0.388889</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>4.331775</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL95</td>\n      <td>6.821023</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>198.115698</td>\n      <td>0.307692</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>2.014719</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL173309</td>\n      <td>7.913640</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>694.539707</td>\n      <td>0.666667</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>50</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>2.803680</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL1128</td>\n      <td>6.698970</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>201.092042</td>\n      <td>0.400000</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>3.185866</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>5 rows × 25 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe pKi column was used in the code below as it contained the experimental values (calculated from measured Ki values, usually derived from countless lab experiments) collected from different scientific literatures or other sources as stated in ChEMBL.

The reason I started with one tree was because it was no point in building a multiple-tree model if one had no clue about how one tree was built. To learn as much as possible, I had to dissect the multiple-tree version first to focus on one tree at a time.\n\nOne thing I'd like to mention was that rivastigmine was not included in the training dataset because it was actually not a pure AChE inhibitor (as it was also a butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitor), since my focus was purely on AChE at this time, this particular drug was unfortunately excluded. However, I did make sure the other two drugs mentioned previously (donepezil and galantamine) were included in the training dataset. One possible thing to do in the future if I want to improve this was to add BChE as another protein target and perhaps add this as an additional dataset towards the model.\n\nAs described in the subsection of \"Estimate experimental errors\", there were experimental errors of 3-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold estimated based on the provided pKi data. With the prediction model used in this post, the estimated experimental errors would need to be taken into consideration, particularly at the time when the model was being investigated during the model evaluation and validation step (however due to the length of series 2.1 posts, I decided not to add this step yet, but would try to look at this later in the multiple tree model series if this applies).\n\nA bit about the last decision tree plot, tentatively clogp (calculated partition coefficient) might be the crucial molecular feature in deciding whether a molecule might be closer to being an AChE inhibitor. Other important features also included the number of aromatic rings, solvent accessible surface area, number of heterogeneous atoms and so on.\n\nSince the type of AChE inhibitors was not the focus of this series, I won't go into details about which value of pKi or Ki would lead to the ideal AChE inhibitor (the well-known Cheng-Prusoff equation [@Cheng1973] might also lead to many discussions about Ki and IC50 values). This is because there are at least two types of AChE inhibitors available - reversible and irreversible [@Colovic2013]. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine mentioned previously are the commonly known reversible AChE inhibitors. The irreversible type, as the name suggested, is usually used as insecticides or nerve agents. Another reason is that I didn't go into details checking all of the identities for the 10 max phase 4 compounds used in the training set, as I only really made sure that donepezil and galantamine were included in the 10 molecules. If I were to re-model again purely on reversible AChE inhibitors targeting dementia or Alzheimer's disease, I think I had to be quite sure of what I was training the model with, i.e. excluding irreversible AChE inhibitors from the training set.\n\nHowever, if our aim was to only find novel AChE inhibitors in a general manner, one of the ways to check post-model building would be to re-run the dataframe again on compounds with max phase as null, including the molecular feature names to find out which compounds were at the predicted threshold cut-off values to see if their corresponding pKi values (note: even these preclinical compounds had Ki values extracted from literature sources etc.) would match the predicted ones. One caveat of this method was that there might be pre-existing experimental errors in all the obtained and recorded Ki values, so this might not confirm that the model was truly a good reflection of the real-life scenario. Therefore, at most, this would probably add a very small value during the model evaluation phase.\n\nThe best way would be to test all of these compounds in the same experimental set-ups, through same experimental steps, and in the same laboratory to find out their respective Ki (or pKi) values. However, this was most likely not very feasible due to various real-life restrictions (the availability of financial and staffing resources). The most likely outcome might be to choose a selected group of compound candidates with the highest possibilities to proceed in the drug discovery pipeline based on past experimental, ML and clinical experiences, and then test them in the ways mentioned here.\n\nI also came across a [blog post](https://www.valencekjell.com/posts/2022-09-14-prediction-intervals/) about calculating the prediction intervals of ML prediction models (which mentioned the [MAPIE package](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE)), but I didn't quite get time to look into this package yet, but from what I have read in its repository link, it potentially could be quite useful for classification, regression and time-series models during the model evaluation step.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Final words**\n\nI didn't think a definite conclusion could be drawn here, as this was only purely from one single decision tree, so I have named this last part as \"final words\", as I felt if I didn't stop here, this post or series 2.1 could go on forever or as long it could go. The main thing here was to fully understand how one single decision tree was constructed based on hopefully reasonable-ish data (still not the best I reckon as I could not rule out all the noises from the data), and then to view the tree visually in different styles of plots, and understand how this was a white-box ML approach with clear features or descriptions shown to trace where the tree would branch off to which nodes to reach different final outcomes or targets.\n\nThe most important thing was that this series was really a preamble before the multiple-tree models e.g. random forest and boosted trees, as I have bravely planned to do a series of posts on tree models, so that might take a while, slowly but hopefully surely.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Acknowledgements**\n\nI'd like to thank all the authors of the open-source packages used in this series 2.1 posts. I'd also like to thank all the authors of all the blog posts mentioned in this series as well as I've learnt a lot from them too.\n\n",
