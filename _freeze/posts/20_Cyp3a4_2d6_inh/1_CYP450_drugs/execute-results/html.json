To further explore the underlying mechanisms of actions (e.g. putative or active binding sites) of these CYP inhibitors, the structures of CYPs should be examined at the same time ideally.\n\nBelow is a general outline of the post:\n\n- Small introduction on drug toxicology and metabolism regarding CYPs\n    - citing data sources for drug structural alerts in ChEMBL\n    - a thought on another drug metabolism data source\n- Data extraction using chembl_downloader\n- Data import and preprocessing\n- Quick check on structural validities\n- Further look into duplicated structures and stereochemistries\n    - quinidine\n    - itraconazole\n- Maximum common substructures\n    - CYP3A4 inhibitors\n    - CYP2D6 inhibitors\n    - Some other interesting code re. MCS\n- Some small findings and possible future work\n- Acknowledgements\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Some introductions**\n\nI initially want to work on something about drug toxicology without setting any goals or intentions on how this post will end (bit like a free-style post) and currently I feel it will be more to do with metabolism, which is also directly linked to drug toxicity, an important area not to ignore during any therapeutic drug discovery and developmental work.\n\nThis post is sort of inspired by a recent commentary that talks about \"avoidome\" and DMPK-related proteins to avoid [@Fraser2024]. I also happen to encounter two other blog posts ([a post from D. Lowe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/john-keats-would-word), and [another one from P. Kenny](https://fbdd-lit.blogspot.com/2024/03/)) that have provided reviews on this commentary recently with interesting view points.\n\nIn a very rough sense, three main areas have been looked at (not exhaustive) with the aim to create safer therapeutic drugs: \n\n1. **Structural alerts** on compound substructures that are known to cause adverse drug effects or pan-assay interference compounds (PAINs)\n\n    Many have looked into structural alerts (an example repo: [rd_filters](https://github.com/PatWalters/rd_filters)). ChEMBL database has already had a cheminformatic utils web service developed that provides structural alert computations for compounds. There are most likely much more efforts than these ones.\n\n2. Toxicophores in relation to **human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel** (related to structural alerts as well)\n\n    hERG potassium channel is also another frequently-looked-at aspect for drug toxicology due to its known effect leading to cardiac QT prolongations or more commonly known as arrhythmias [@Curran1995].\n\n3. **CYP enzymes** with the well-known ones as CYP3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19\n\n    CYP450 enzymes play a key role in the metabolism and toxicology parts of the ADMET process of drugs. When a drug behaves like a cytochrome inhibitor, it inhibits the activity of a particular cytochrome enzyme e.g. CYP3A4 leading to a reduction of clearance of a particular therapeutic drug e.g. a CYP3A4 substrate such as apixaban, thus increasing its plasma concentration *in vivo* causing a higher chance of adverse effect (which in the context of apixaban, this means the poor person taking the apixaban may get excessive bleeding...).\n\nOther useful categories involve drug-induced skin sensitisations and liver injuries and more.\n\nMy very inital naive thought is that if we can at least cover some of the drug toxicology part during drug design and discovery process, this may be able to save some resources along the way (obviously it won't be this simple...). The main thing here is that it may still be useful and interesting to look into the relationship between CYP450 and small drug molecules - to see if there are anything worth further explorations. This post will start with the two largest groups of CYP inhibitors, so focussing on CYP3A4 and 2D6 first.\n\nWhile my focus is only on a very small cohort of small molecules relating to only two CYPs, it is also worth noting that there are actually more CYPs present as well, for example, CYP1A1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2E1, 2J2, 3A5 (note: amlodipine is a moderate CYP3A5 inhibitor and will be looked at below), 3A7 and 4F2 [@Guengerich2021]. The cited paper here also provides quite a comprehensive background on the history of CYP450 and their relevance to toxicities in drugs, so I won't repeat them here.\n\n<br>\n\n###### **More on structural alerts**\n\nI am only really curious about the data sources used to build these ChEMBL structural alerts, so below are some of my notes on these sources.\n\nFrom ChEMBL 20, only 6 filters are present, as shown by this [ChEMBL blogpost](http://chembl.blogspot.com/2015/02/chembl-20-released.html) - it may appear that this blog post cites all 8 filters but in fact it only has 6. I've attempted to find out the sources of these ChEMBL structural alert sets, here they are:\n\n* [Pfizer LINT filters](https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/24760)\n\n* [Glaxo Wellcome hard filters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci990423o)\n\n* [BMS HTS Deck Filters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci050504m)\n\n* [NIH MLSMR Excluded Functionality Filters](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/12367541/mlsmr-excluded-functionality-filters-nih-molecular-libraries-) (the old link provided in the old ChEMBL blog post is no longer available, this is found via [KNIME's REOS Tagger webpage](https://hub.knime.com/knime/spaces/Examples/00_Components/Life%20Sciences/REOS%20Tagger~bWMuzeSbFgbCrLWA/current-state))\n\n* [University of Dundee NTD Screening Library Filters](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmdc.200700139) (also known as \"Brenk filter\" in RDKit)\n\n* [PAINS filters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm901137j)\n\nFrom ChEMBL 20 to 23, there are 8 filters in total (agreed with rd_filters' README.md that there aren't many documentations about this in ChEMBL, as I've tried also), the sources of the two additional ones are as follow:\n\n* Inpharmatica - unable to find direct source initially but this is later confirmed as private communications between ChEMBL and Inpharmatica Ltd. in the earlier days - an older ChEMBL presentation on ChEMBL 09 mentions about this, and this is also further elaborated by this paper [@chembl2017]\n\n* [SureChEMBL](https://chembl.gitbook.io/surechembl/chemical-search/smarts-search) (old link provided by the paper [@chembl2017] also no longer exists)\n\nRDKit (section on [\"Filtering unwanted substructures\"](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#filtering-unwanted-substructures)) also has another NIH filter based on two other references [@Jadhav2010] and [@Doveston2015]. At one point I'm so confused with this NIH filter here and the NIH MLSMR one above... they are actually different as different papers are cited. \n\nRDKit also uses the above 8 filters mentioned in ChEMBL in its [FilterCatalogs](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdfiltercatalog.html#rdkit.Chem.rdfiltercatalog.FilterCatalogParams.FilterCatalogs) class currently. Brenk filter seems to be the same as the CHEMBL_Dundee one since both of them have quoted the same journal paper as reference. It's also got a ZINC one I think. Before I get very carried away, I'll stop searching for every structural alerts papers here as there are many in the literatures.\n\n<br>\n\n###### **More on CYPs and ADMET**\n\nA bit of a sidetrack for this part (feel free to skip) as I come across a new paper online recently about using deep learning model for ADMET prediction which uses data from Therapeutics data commons (TDC). So while working on this relevant topic of CYP and ADMET (only the metabolism and toxicology parts), I just want to dig a bit deeper to see what sort of data are used by TDC.\n\nThe [TDC ADME dataset](https://tdcommons.ai/single_pred_tasks/adme/#metabolism), specifically the metabolism one on all five CYP isoenzymes (CYP2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 1A2 and 2C9), are all derived from a 2009 paper by [Veith et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783980/). A closer look at this paper only seems to mention:\n\n> ...we tested 17,143 samples at between seven and fifteen concentrations for all five CYP isozymes. The samples consisted of 8,019 compounds from the MLSMR including compounds chosen for diversity and rule-of-five compliance, 16 synthetic tractability, and availability; 6,144 compounds from a set of biofocused libraries which included 1,114 FDA-approved drugs; and 2,980 compounds from combinatorial libraries containing privileged structures targeted at GPCRs and kinases, and libraries of purified natural products or related structures...\n\nIf I go to its original journal paper site (the link provided was a NCBI one), there is only one additional Excel file with a long list of chemical scaffolds showing different CYP activities (no other supplementary information I can spot there). The only likely lists of compounds tested are shown in its figures 6 and 7 in the paper, where figure 7 is more relevant for drug-drug interactions. I then realise the proportions of FDA-approved drugs used and the rest of the molecules tested in this paper are also not very balanced (thinking along the line of approved drugs and non-approved drugs), and notice that what they are saying in its discussion about how they are not noticing the usual prominent activities of CYP3A4 and 2D6 in the compounds they've tested:\n\n> ...It has been suggested that CYP 3A4 is the most prominent P450 isozyme in drug metabolism and hepatic distribution (Fig. 2b),^25^^,^ ^26^ but the drugs in our collection do not appear to have been optimized away from this activity. There has also been speculation that CYP 2D6 isozyme plays a prominent role in drug metabolism,^27^ but no difference in activity was observed between diversity compounds and approved drugs for this isozyme...\n\nI wonder if this may be due to the imbalanced set of compounds used e.g. number of FDA-approved drug (smaller) vs. number of other compounds from other libraries (larger)...\n\nI've also visited FDA's website to look at how the CYP stories are compiled ([FDA link](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions-table-substrates-inhibitors-and-inducers)). The *in vitro* inhibitors and clinical index inhibitors are not completely the same across all the CYPs. There are some overlappings in CYP3A4/5 and 2D6 for sure but definitely not exactly the same across all the documented CYPs in this FDA webpage. \n\nSo back to this new paper on predicting ADMET... how likely will it be useful in real-life hit/lead ADMET optimisation projects in drug discovery settings if the data source only involves a larger portion of non-approved drugs versus a smaller portion of actual FDA-approved drugs?... It just shows that there are a lot of things to think about in the DMPK/ADMET areas within drug discovery pipelines, as ultimately this is crucial to see if a candidate molecule will proceed or not (i.e. causing toxicity or not and whether it's tolerable side effects or adverse or even life-threatening ones instead).\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Extracting data**\n\nFirst step here is to import the following software packages in order to retrieve and work with ChEMBL data (again).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport chembl_downloader\nfrom chembl_downloader import latest\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Draw, AllChem\n# For maximum common substructures & labelling stereocentres\nfrom rdkit.Chem import rdFMCS, rdCIPLabeler\nfrom rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole\nIPythonConsole.drawOptions.addAtomIndices = False\n# Change to false to remove stereochem labels\nIPythonConsole.drawOptions.addStereoAnnotation = True\nIPythonConsole.ipython_useSVG=True\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Latest version of ChEMBL\nlatest_version = latest()\nprint(f\"The latest ChEMBL version is: {latest_version}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe latest ChEMBL version is: 34\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI'm using SQL via chembl_downloader to download approved drugs with their ChEMBL ID and equivalent canonical SMILES. All of the CYP3A4 and 2D6 inhibitors extracted from ChEMBL are based on the [Flockhart table of drug interactions](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx) [@Flockhart2021].\n\nNote: Three other categories of medicines are not going to be looked at for now, which are the weak inhibitors, ones with *in vitro* evidence only and ones that are still pending reviews.\n\nA bit about retrieving data here, the following may not be the best way to get the data, but I've somehow incorporated chembl_downloader into my own small piece of function code (see Python script named as \"cyp_drugs.py\" in the [repo](https://github.com/jhylin/CYP450_and_drug_mols)) to retrieve SMILES of approved drugs (other public databases may also work very well equally, but I'm used to using ChEMBL now as it's easy to read and navigate). \n\nAnother possible way is to use get_target_sql() within chembl_downloader, e.g. using a specific CYP enzyme as the protein target to retrieve data, but it appears that there are no clear data marked to indicate the potency of CYP inhibition or induction (i.e. weak, moderate or strong) in the ChEMBL database (an [example link for CYP2D6 in ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/web_components/explore/activities/STATE_ID:pxs_ydUxNelxmAa9ckYEPw%3D%3D)). The Flockhart table has clearly annotated each approved drug with journal paper citations so I decide to stick with the previous method.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n##

the other one is without due to the presence of \"@\" in the SMILES string for the one at index row 4. The output images show exactly that - one with chiral centres, where the other one doesn't have any.\n\nPubChem calculations have however generated different result for itraconazole. It seems it only has one defined atom stereocentre count and two undefined stereocentre counts ([PubChem reference](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/44428219#section=Computed-Properties&fullscreen=true)).\n\nI've also noted that the two itraconzoles obtained from ChEMBL have different ChEMBL ID numbers (ChEMBL IDs: CHEMBL22587 and CHEMBL64391) to the one calculated in PubChem (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL224725). So below I've looked into CHEMBL224725 first.\n\nThen I realise that if I search for \"itraconazole\" directly in ChEMBL, only four entries will appear with ChEMBL IDs of CHEMBL64391, CHEMBL22587, CHEMBL882 and CHEMBL5090785, and there is no ChEMBL224725. This is all due to a small spelling error (which is most likely a typo by accident) of itraconazole - being spelled as \"itraconzole\", which is also carried over into PubChem as well. I have checked again to make sure both \"itraconzole\" and the usual itraconazole are referring to the same chemical structure. Below are some screenshots showing the typo. ![Screenshot of \"itraconzole\" in ChEMBL database](chembl_itracon.png) ![Screenshot of \"itraconzole\" in PubChem that was inherited from ChEMBL](pubchem_itracon.png) \n\nSo to add this likely-mis-spelled \"itraconzole\" into the dataframe, I literally just add it into the SQL query above when obtaining drug information through chembl_downloader.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# SMILES of new addition - \"itraconzole\"\ndf_3a4_s_inh_p.loc[6, \"canonical_smiles\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output

Without looking into other cross-referencing sources, and if only sticking with PubChem for now, I've then gone back to check all 3 (stereochemically-)different versions of itraconazole and found that the RDKit stereochemical calculations of these 3 itraconazoles have all basically matched their equivalent PubChem computations for atom sterecentre counts.\n\n[CHEMBL22587 - PubChem CID

I'm interested in trying out so below are some examples of finding MCS in these CYP inhibitors. Please note that MCS may not be the most suitable strategy to look at these CYP inhibitors, I'm only using it to become a bit more familiar with it so that I can better understand MCS.\n\nSome information regarding MCS in RDKit:\n\n* [FindMCS](https://rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdFMCS.html) is for 2 or more molecules and returns single-fragment MCS - based on FMCS algorithm [@dalke2013]\n\n* RascalMCES (maximum common edge substructures) is for 2 molecules only and returns multi-fragment MCES. A [RDKit blog post](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2023-11-08-introducingrascalmces.html) by Dave Cosgrove talks about this in more details\n\nSome code examples to refer to:\n\n* A [RDKit code example](https://rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#findmcs) may be a good starting point to learn about MCS\n\n* [TeachOpenCADD's MCS talktorial](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T006_compound_maximum_common_substructures.html) - a nice tutorial-like piece that introduces MCS and explains about the FMCS algorithm\n\n* [\"Customising MCS mapping in rdkit\"](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2023/06/customising-mcs-mapping-in-rdkit/) -

The main thing I can see from the code is that it begins with finding MCS for the input molecules, then uses SMARTS strings of the MCS in order to find atoms not within the MCS (using [GetSubstructMatch()](https://rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdchem.html#rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol.GetSubstructMatch) part) then highlights that part of the molecules.\n\n<br>\n\n###### **All CYP2D6 inhibitors**\n\nBecause of how the MCSes have turned out for CYP3A4 inhibitors above, I think I should just look at CYP2D6 inhibitors as a whole here. First thing is to combine the dataframes between the moderate and strong inhibitor groups.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=45}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Concatenate dfs \ndf_2d6_all = pd.concat([df_2d6_s_inh_p, df_2d6_m_inh_p])\n# index un-changed for now\nprint(df_2d6_all.shape)\ndf_2d6_all.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(14, 9)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=45}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>chembl_id</th>\n      <th>pref_name</th>\n      <th>max_phase</th>\n      <th>canonical_smiles</th>\n      <th>rdkit_mol</th>\n      <th>standard_smiles</th>\n      <th>selfies</th>\n      <th>inchi</th>\n      <th>inchikey</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL894</td>\n      <td>BUPROPION</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>CC(NC(C)(C)C)C(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1</td>\n      <td>&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x135da3530&gt;</td>\n      <td>CC(NC(C)(C)C)C(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1</td>\n      <td>[C][C][Branch1][#Branch2][N][C][Branch1][C][C]...</td>\n      <td>InChI=1S/C13H18ClNO/c1-9(15-13(2,3)4)12(16)10-...</td>\n      <td>SNPPWIUOZRMYNY-UHFFFAOYSA-N</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL41</td>\n      <td>FLUOXETINE</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>CNCCC(Oc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1)c1ccccc1</td>\n      <td>&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x135da3290&gt;</td>\n      <td>CNCCC(Oc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1)c1ccccc1</td>\n      <td>[C][N][C][C][C][Branch2][Ring1][Ring2][O][C][=...</td>\n      <td>InChI=1S/C17H18F3NO/c1-21-12-11-16(13-5-3-2-4-...</td>\n      <td>RTHCYVBBDHJXIQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL490</td>\n      <td>PAROXETINE</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>Fc1ccc([C@@H]2CCNC[C@H]2COc2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)cc1</td>\n      <td>&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x135da3bc0&gt;</td>\n      <td>Fc1ccc([C@@H]2CCNC[C@H]2COc2ccc3c(c2)OCO3)cc1</td>\n      <td>[F][C][=C][C][=C][Branch2][Ring1][#Branch2][C@...</td>\n      <td>InChI=1S/C19H20FNO3/c20-15-3-1-13(2-4-15)17-7-...</td>\n      <td>AHOUBRCZNHFOSL-YOEHRIQHSA-N</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL1294</td>\n      <td>QUINIDINE</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>C=C[C@H]1CN2CC[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@@H](O)c1ccnc2cc...</td>\n      <td>&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x135da2d50&gt;</td>\n      <td>C=C[C@H]1CN2CC[C@H]1C[C@@H]2[C@@H](O)c1ccnc2cc...</td>\n      <td>[C][=C][C@H1][C][N][C][C][C@H1][Ring1][=Branch...</td>\n      <td>InChI=1S/C20H24N2O2/c1-3-13-12-22-9-7-14(13)10...</td>\n      <td>LOUPRKONTZGTKE-LHHVKLHASA-N</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>CHEMBL254328</td>\n      <td>ABIRATERONE</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>C[C@]12CC[C@H](O)CC1=CC[C@@H]1[C@@H]2CC[C@]2(C...</td>\n      <td>&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x135dd0270&gt;</td>\n      <td>C[C@]12CC[C@H](O)CC1=CC[C@@H]1[C@@H]2CC[C@]2(C...</td>\n      <td>[C][C@][C][C][C@H1][Branch1][C][O][C][C][Ring1...</td>\n      <td>InChI=1S/C24H31NO/c1-23-11-9-18(26)14-17(23)5-...</td>\n      <td>GZOSMCIZMLWJML-VJLLXTKPSA-N</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=46}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmols_all_2d6 = list(df_2d6_all[\"rdkit_mol\"])\n\n# Find MCS for all CYP2D6 inhibitors\nall_2d6_mcs = rdFMCS.FindMCS(mols_all_2d6)\n\n# Get images of highlighted MCS for all CYP2D6 inhibitors\nDraw.MolsToGridImage(\n    mols_all_2d6, \n    subImgSize=(400, 300), \n    molsPerRow=2, \n    legends = list(df_2d6_all[\"pref_name\"]), \n    highlightAtomLists=[m.GetSubstructMatch(all_2d6_mcs.queryMol) for m in mols_all_2d6]\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=46}\n![](1_CYP450_drugs_files/figure-html/cell-47-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAgain, only a phenyl ring is highlighted as the MCS so this is not informative at all.\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Some findings and future work**\n\nBelow are some of my small findings and thoughts.\n\n* As mentioned at the very top in the outline section, rings (heterocycles, aromatic or fused ones) are everywhere in the MCSes for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, and they are very common in known approved drugs\n\n* Looking at CYP structures in relation to these inhibitors may be more meaningful and also may reveal more insights about possible binding sites or mechanisms of actions of CYP inhibitions for these compounds. This may also be further explored in parallel to the actual drug targets of these CYP inhibitors e.g. binding site on CYP isoenzyme versus binding site on drug target protein as there are different classes of drugs within these CYP inhibitors. For example, some of CYP2D6 inhibitors are drugs acting on central nervous system (about 9 out of 14 drugs) - e.g. bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, clobazam, doxepin, duloxetine, locaserin, moclobemide and rolapitant. For the CYP3A4 inhibitors, they are in several different therapeutic classes e.g. antivirals, antifungals, antibacterials, kinase inhibitors etc.\n\n* It may be a bit more interesting to compare the MCSes between CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates (adding in other substrates for other CYPs)\n\n* Future posts may involve looking at CYP substrates using different cheminformatics strategies or doing molecular docking within a notebook setting (has this been done before?)\n\n* CYP inducers are a different story as they tend to increase drug metabolisms via CYP inductions, which are more likely to do with losing therapeutic effects than gaining adverse effects, so they may be looked at further down the line\n\n* MCS may not be absolutely useful in every scenario as I think it aims to look for the most maximum common substructures within a set of molecules, so not every molecule will be able to have a MCS shown (e.g. in a very diverse chemical set), other similarity searching techniques should probably be used instead if needed\n\n<br>\n\n##### **Acknowledgements**\n\nThanks to every contributor, developer or authors of every software package used in this post, and also the online communities behind them. Before I forget, the thanks would also be extended to the authors of the journal papers cited in this post. Lastly, special thanks to Noel O'Boyle for being very patient with reading my awfully-long old draft earlier and pointed out some useful things to note and change (I kind of got lost when writing the draft... due to it being a \"free-style post\", I should avoid doing this again).\n\n",
