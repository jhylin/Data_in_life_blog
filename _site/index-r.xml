<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-story"><strong>Back story</strong></h5>
<p>It has been a long while since I’ve used R in my projects. Last year during the time when I bravely embraced the role of rotating curator for <span class="citation" data-cites="WeAreRLadies">@WeAreRLadies</span> on Twitter around end of October, I did mention that I wanted to learn Shiny. I haven’t forgotten about this actually. So as promised, here it is, my first Shiny app in R, which is really a very simple interactive web app about small molecules from ChEMBL database. The URL to reach this app, <a href="https://jhylin.shinyapps.io/ShinyAppChembl/">ShinyAppChembl</a>, is at: https://jhylin.shinyapps.io/ShinyAppChembl/. It shows a selected set of physicochemical properties for the curated small molecules in different max phases in boxplot formats. <strong>Note: it may take a few minutes to load the plot when first opening the app.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>

<section id="the-process" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-process"><strong>The process</strong></h5>
<p>Since I haven’t been using a lot of R lately, I just wanted to document how I approached this Shiny app framework, as part of my self-directed learning for R that started around mid-2022. The first place I went to was not Google’s Bard or OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as I was trying to preempt a scenario where if both of these options were temporarily down, what would I do to learn a new tool. So I visited the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny website</a> first, and literally started from the “Get Started” section there, then tried to read through the lessons provided. I gathered a quick overview about the core components within a Shiny app, which were the user interface, server logic and the call to run or create app in the end, and thought to get started from there.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful online books called, “<a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html">Mastering Shiny</a>” had clarified a few coding issues for me. The reactivity section in the book was very useful as well to help with understanding the interactivity concept in the app. The best and also the hardest thing at this stage after reading some of the information was to actually start coding for the app in RStudio IDE, which I did soon after.</p>
<p><br></p>

<section id="trials-and-errors" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trials-and-errors"><strong>Trials-and-errors</strong></h5>
<p>Initially, I’ve noticed in the gallery section from the Shiny website that some of the basic Shiny apps had plots produced with R code using S3 method - the type with class ‘formula’, such as boxplot(formula e.g.&nbsp;y ~ group, data, and so on). So I started with this first and ended up with a draft version shown below:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">First draft app using S3 method in R code to plot boxplots - screenshot taken by author</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>I then tried the ggplot2 version, which I preferred to use. However, I kept on hitting a roadblock repeatedly (as shown in the image below):</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/12_Shiny_app_chembl/Draft_app_error_2.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Second draft app using ggplot2 boxplot format - screenshot taken by author</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I ended up working through this issue of not being able to display the boxplots properly over at least two days, where I tried to figure out how to change the code so that the boxplots would appear as the output in the app. I actually wrote a plot function code (as shown below) before working on the app.R file, in order to trial plotting the boxplots, making sure that the code worked before using it in the app.R file.</p>

<p>Once I made sure this code worked, I transplanted the code into the server section of the app.R file, however it wasn’t that simple obviously. Through the process of more trials-and-errors, I managed to figure out the code for the plot output in the final version, which was not the same as the function code above, but more like this.</p>

<p>I then read about the section on “Tidy evaluation” in the “Mastering Shiny” book, which had thoroughly described the problems I’ve encountered (and which I wished I had actually read this section before and not after hitting the roadblock…). So I’d highly recommend new users to read this section and also the rest of the book if Shiny’s also new to you.</p>

<section id="app-deployment" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="app-deployment"><strong>App deployment</strong></h5>
<p>After I got the app working, I looked into where I could deploy the app, since my main goal was to learn and share my work. At first, I went to the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/index.html">Shiny section</a> on the Quarto website to see if it was possible to deploy the app in Quarto. However, after reading through several questions and answers in relation to Shiny apps and Quarto website, it was obvious that it was still not possible yet to deploy the app in an interactive way on Quarto websites (but it was mentioned in Posit community that this was being looked into, so I’m looking forward to the day when we can do exactly that in the future). This means that currently, there will only be an app image showing up in a Quarto document at most. I ended up choosing shinyapp.io to deploy my first Shiny app for now.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="about-the-boxplots" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-boxplots"><strong>About the boxplots</strong></h5>
<p>Since the main goal of this post is more on the process of producing a simple Shiny app for a new comer, I won’t go into the fine details to describe how these boxplots differ between different max phases. Also as a side note, I’m aware that some experts in data visualisations might not really like boxplots in general, but for my case, I’ve got molecules in different max phases where a boxplot is presented for each max phase lining up next to each other. Therefore, in a way, some relative comparisons or differences could be drawn visually in the first glance, although other graph types such as density plots or heat maps might be better options.</p>
<p>I’ll focus on the “QED Weighted” variable here, as it’s a physicochemical property that has combined several molecular features together as a score (please refer to <a href="https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/08_ML1_Small_molecules_in_ChEMBL_database/ML1_chembl_cpds.html">this post - section: “Some exploratory data analysis”</a> for details about this QED weighted score). For all the boxplots shown when “QED Weighted” is selected from the drop-down box, max phase 4 molecules obviously have higher QED weighted scores in general than all of the other max phases. This is especially clear when comparing the medians between them, with max phase 4 small molecules having a median QED weighted score of more than 0.5, and the rest of the other max phases had 0.5 or below. The higher the QED weighted scores, the more druglike the molecules will be, and for max phase 4 molecules, they are mostly prescription medicines that have already reached approval and are already being widely prescribed. So this makes sense as this is being reflected in the boxplots for these ChEMBL small molecules.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="final-words" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-words"><strong>Final words</strong></h5>
<p>Finally, I’m quite pleasantly surprised that there is also a Shiny in Python version, which has a Shinylive option to deploy Shiny app interactively in GitHub Gist and so on… I’ll most likely need to read further into this and make this as my next project. This is also a nice break from my recent machine learning projects, which I’ll try to return to once I’ve had enough fun with Shiny!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

  <title>Long COVID - an update</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="background" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h4>
<p>This was another update on the current long COVID saga around the world that I thought to follow up from my earlier work (details in the <a href="https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/2.%20Long%20COVID%20data%20in%20SQL/LongCOVIDSQL.html">SQL</a> and <a href="https://jhylin.github.io/Data-analytics-and-research-blog/posts/3.%20Long%20COVID%20dashboard/TableauDashboard.html">Tableau</a> projects). This time the dataset was obtained from another journal paper, which had data collected until July 2021 (the previous paper was only until March 2021). I’ve used Python to extract a table from the PDF of the paper and also Excel to assist with data cleaning. This was followed by using R to analyse and visualise all the data.</p>
</section>
<section id="source-of-dataset" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="source-of-dataset"><strong>Source of dataset</strong></h4>
<p>Journal paper by Healey Q, Sheikh A, Daines L, Vasileiou E. Symptoms and signs of long COVID: A rapid review and meta-analysis. J Glob Health 2022;12:05014. <em>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License</em></p>
</section>
<section id="data-scraping-from-pdf" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-scraping-from-pdf"><strong>Data scraping from PDF</strong></h4>
<p>The dataset was scraped from a PDF obtained via PubMed (journal paper source as shown above) by using tabula-py (<em>for details please see this post, “<a href="https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/6.%20Long%20COVID%20update/ExtractTableFromPDF.html">Table scraping from PDF</a>”</em>). Unfortunately I had trouble installing a similar R package remotely after it was archived (tabulizer package with known issues in its GitHub repository) so I trialled tabula-py instead. It worked for scraping all the data from the target table, but the downside was that the scraped data did not inherit the original tabular format on PDF, with columns and rows all jumbled. I’ve discussed a little bit more on the likely reason for this in the blog post link above. So in short, the final scraped table was cleaned in Excel and saved as .csv file, which was then imported as shown below.</p>

<p>The table column of Hospital (%) {ICU (%)} was separated into two separate columns to allow clearer differentiation between hospital and ICU rates within each study. The data type for Hospital (%) column was also changed from character to numeric so we can plot a bar graph later on (otherwise the x-axis may not be accurate or properly shown).</p>

<p>I then noticed how the comorbidities for each study were listed with different percentages and to gather a quick initial overall picture of the data, I started by removing these digits and percentage symbols. Obviously since I was still quite new to R (started using R in July), I soon ran into a problem as I kept on getting stuck with not having the count() function to actually count unique elements under the co-morbidities column.</p>
<p>By looking at the magnified circle on the right in the image below, you would notice a subtle difference in spacing, so yes the culprit was the <strong>space</strong><sup>1</sup> and once it was removed, count() worked nicely as how it should be. One small downside was that it would also remove the space between the co-morbidity terms e.g.&nbsp;“liver disease” became “liverdisease”, but since it achieved the aim intended to do unique counts on all the co-morbidities, I left it as it was.</p>

<p>Now we could observe the top 3 frequency of all co-morbidities listed were: diabetes, hypertension and IHD<sup>2</sup>. These were followed by, unsurprisingly, common respiratory illnesses such as asthma, COPD<sup>3</sup>, then obesity, and also CKD<sup>4</sup>, malignancy, dyslipidaemia and so on. These would be considered as high risk factors of developing long COVID symptoms if someone had these co-morbidities present before being infected by the coronoviruses.</p>

<p>Then a line of code to filter out the results of “NA” under the column of Hospital (%) was added. Most of the cells with “NA” were there to fill the multiple empty row entries for other variables and not for the Hospital (%) column, therefore these “NA”s were removed in this instance. The horizontal bar graph below showed the COVID-19 hospitalisation rate for studies in different countries, presenting a very diverse results between 0% and 100% hospitalisations across all 19 cohort studies.</p>

<p>I realised that map_data(“world”) showed all the longitudes and latitudes for subregions of each country, which might not be required for the map I wanted. So after trialling the map visualisation several times, I opted to use centroids of each country instead, to leave the map in a cleaner and easy-to-see state. Otherwise one of the maps I tested before ended up with countless blobs of circles marking the boundaries of each country, looking like a 5-year-old’s map drawing!</p>

<p>A known drawback of wordcloud was that the length of a word might influence how big it might appear in the wordcloud, so it was not completely dependent on the word frequencies in a set of texts. Nevertheless, it was one of the ways to get a rough idea about the most common terms cropping up in collected texts. This last part was more like a small exercise for me and also for anyone who might want to try this but did not where to start.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h4>
<p>Long COVID had shown a very versatile and diverse range of signs and symptoms, often resembling other known post-viral illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome, the interactive map above would enable readers to see specific long COVID symptoms for selected countries. People with diabetes, hypertension and IHD might have higher risk of suffering from long COVID if they were infected with the coronoviruses. The types of co-morbidities were not limited to these three unfortunately and several other chronic illnesses mentioned above might also contribute to similar risk. The most affected body systems in long COVID were in respiratory tract, ear, nose and throat areas, musculoskeletal parts, gastrointestinal tract and last, but not the least, neuropsychiatric systems which could bring fatigue and memory/concentration issue, or more widely known as the “brain fog”. All of these outcomes also did not vary widely from earlier meta-analyses on long COVID, reiterating the wide health ramifications that COVID-19 could inflict upon global populations.</p>

<p>This dataset was also derived and downloaded from Orphanet, as another part in the “rare diseases” series. It contained 37 columns with 112,243 rows originally, which took quite a long time to load on RStudio (or could be due to my laptop capacity…). It loaded relatively faster on Jupyter notebook from Anaconda, so I then decided to clean it up first using Python<sup>1</sup> there. Some columns were removed which reduced the total number of columns from 37 to 13, while not changing any of the rows at all. The columns were also renamed to make it easier to read.</p>

<p>Since I wasn’t intending for this project<sup>2</sup> to be extremely long (as most people would likely lose interests by then), I’d like to first ask a question about the dataset, in order to keep it at a reasonably short but informative length. So, here’s the question: what are the most common rare disorders and their associated phenotypic features?</p>
<p>To answer it, let’s observe the spread of the disorder groups and types first by formulating a contingency table.</p>

<p>After a quick view on the column of “Disorder group”, it mainly provided different disorder types a group label for each, which to a certain extent, was not necessary at this early stage. So this column was removed for now from the contingency table, in order to focus solely on, “Disorder type” with the number of counts (or times it appeared in the dataset).</p>

<p>Two disorder types stood out the most, with “Disease” type appeared 57,920 times and “Malformation syndrome” at 37,634 times. To understand further what each of these two disorder types were, a direct reference<sup>3</sup> was used. According to the source of the dataset:</p>
<p>The definition of “Disease” in the rare disorder context was “a disorder with homogeneous therapeutic possibilities and an identified physiopathological mechanism…”, one thing also worth noting was that this type did not include any developmental anomalies.</p>
<p>For “Malformation syndrome”, this was defined as, “A disorder resulting from a developmental anomaly involving more than one morphogenetic field. Malformative sequences and associations are included.”</p>
<p>To demonstrate this in a tabular form, with corresponding proportions of each disorder type in the dataset, the following codes were used:</p>

<p>As shown in the dataframe above, under the column name, “Preferred HPO term”, there were a total of ten different HPO phenotype terms associated with this particular rare disease with 100% HPO frequency within the patient population for this specific type of spastic paraplegia.</p>
<p>By using similar filtering method, we could quickly narrow down any particular rare disease of interest to find out specific phenotype or clinical features, along with associated HPO phenotype frequency, for further investigations.</p>
<p>For “Malformation syndrome”, a similar search process was used to find out what was the most common phenotypes associated with it.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explore-rare-disease-validation-date"><strong>Explore rare disease validation date</strong></h5>
<p>Now, to add one more piece of work towards this exploratory data analysis, I thought to check out the Validation date column. “Validation date” in this context meant the dates when the annotations of HPO terms were made for each rare disorder, which were based on the source articles listed (as shown in the Source column).</p>
<p>Firstly, I started with the “Disease” disorder type and singled out the year component from the Validation date column.</p>

<p>Then to make it easier to visualise, the year counts were plotted in a bar graph. Interestingly, 2016 seemed to be the year for rare disorders to be annotated with the most phenotypic features (if referring back to the original dataset, each observation or row was present for a unique “Preferred HPO term” or phenotypic abnormality).</p>

<p>It was also worth noting that there were 49 rows of non-finite values excluded from the bar graph above. To look into this, a count on the year column of the dataframe df_val_date_d was done, which confirmed that these were the “NA” or missing values in the validation date column.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Since it is common knowledge that it takes a very long time to discover and develop novel therpapeutic drugs. I’ve also often wondered about drugs for rare diseases and how they’re often for the minorities in the diseased populations. So here is the initial Python and R projects<sup>1</sup> about rare disease drugs by using data extracted from FDA’s <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/index.cfm#Search_param_field%23Search_param_field">Orphan Drug Product designation database</a>. I also have to acknowledge “<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com">Data Is Plural</a>” website, which has inspired me to look into this dataset.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this particular dataset I’ve obtained does not contain information on incentives for pharmaceutical companies (from US’s Orphan Drug Act of 1983), which could mean that I might be able to draw some preliminary, basic or raw correlations between incentives and rare disease drug marketing approvals (this might lead to other controversial discussions about this area, which was not my initial aim for this project as I just wanted to explore a dataset on rare disease drugs at the moment).</p>
<p>The datatset was for the period from 1983 till present, for approved rare disease drugs only.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-project"><strong>Python project</strong></h3>
<p>For Python project<sup>2</sup>, there was one question in mind to answer:</p>
<p>How long did it take on average for a rare disease drug to reach marketing approval?</p>
<p><strong>Python version of the data analysis</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/jhylin/Portfolio-projects/blob/main/Rare%20disease%20drugs%20-%20approved%20only.ipynb">link</a></p>
<p><strong>Short summary of findings from this dataset using Python</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The orphan designation for rare disease drug that had the highest counts between 1983 till present was for the treatment of multiple myeloma</p></li>
<li><p>The highest counts of final approved indication for rare disease drugs spanned across several different clinical indications – it often ended up with more indication details than the initial orphan designation phase</p></li>
<li><p>The average time required for a rare disease drug to progress from the initial designation phase to the final approval for marketing was about 1932 days (~5 years)</p></li>
<li><p>The horizontal bar graph (access from link above) showed the top ten rare disease drugs with the longest time taken to reach the market Tiopronin was the one that took the longest time of 12,215 days (~33 years)</p></li>
<li><p>The data for Tiopronin appeared to be duplicates, but note that the two were formulated differently as one of them was the enteric-coated (EC) version (marketed as delayed-release tablets under the actual trade name of “Thiola EC”, but recorded in the dataset as “Thiola” only), while the other one was the immediate-release form (Thiola)</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="r-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-project"><strong>R project</strong></h3>
<p>For R project<sup>3</sup>, there were two questions in mind to answer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What countries were involved in rare disease drug developments?</p></li>
<li><p>How would the time from designation to approval be displayed in timeline style for selected rare disease drugs?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>R versions of the data analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>base R methods via Jupyter notebook with <a href="https://github.com/jhylin/Portfolio-projects/blob/main/Rare%20disease%20drugs%20(base%20R%20methods).ipynb">link</a></p></li>
<li><p>Tidyverse version via RStudio with <a href="https://github.com/jhylin/Portfolio-projects/blob/main/Rare_diseases_drugs_RStudio.md">link</a> - done using RMarkdown</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Short summary of findings from this dataset using R</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>US was the country that had the most involvement in rare disease drug developments, which was followed by Ireland and the UK, and also a number of other countries</p></li>
<li><p>More work could possibly go into looking at the duplicates of brand names of the same generic drug e.g.&nbsp;cannabidiol with trade name as Epidiolex that had 5 repeated timelines (shown in link above), which appeared to be different clinical indications for each of these entries after further checks</p></li>
<li><p>The timelines have also implied that drug discovery and development is a very timely process, which could span many years, such as 10 – 20 years or more, before a drug actually reaches the market for public use</p></li>
</ul>
