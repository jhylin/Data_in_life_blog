    "text": "Aside from being a Taiwanese New Zealander, I stumbled upon the world involving computers a long time ago, and always had an interest in them but didn’t quite go down that career path and ended up having my training to become a pharmacist instead. I worked as a community and hospital pharmacist for many years in New Zealand and Australia (this also happened while doing my master and PhD studies). My interest in the computer and data world was re-ignited from the end of 2021, after completing my PhD on using computer-aided drug design in small molecule discovery in 2020.\nI currently work as a freelance data scientist, and I’m also an enthusiast in using Python mainly (plus R to a smaller extent, and I did play with Rust a little) to work with drug discovery and development data. I’m still very much humbled by everything that is happening in the computational or digital chemistry, cheminformatics and computer-aided drug design fields, as there are a vast amount of information, theories, techniques and experiments to be learnt and absorbed. I also particularly would like to thank several well-known and experienced figures in these areas, which I’ve often mentioned in my blog posts, for their generous sharing of experiences and knowledge through various means.\nWhile sharing my work, I also hope that these work will help people, who are interested in these areas, to get started in coding and learning about the computational side of pharmaceutical chemistry and drug discovery. I’m currently still working on new projects, always trying to brainstorm for the next idea, and also open to any work opportunaties or project collaborations.\nThanks for visiting.\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Post updated on 3rd May 2024 - Added comment regarding ImbalancedLearningRegression package (installation tip) & Jupyter notebook link of this post\n\nQuick overview of this post\n\nShort introduction of random forest\nRandom forest methods or classes in scikit-learn\nRandom forest regressor model in scikit-learn\nTraining and testing data splits\n\nChEMBL-assigned max phase splits\nImbalanced learning regression and max phase splits\n\nScoring metrics of trained models\nFeature importances in dataset\n\nfeature_importances_attribute in scikit-learn\npermutation_importance function in scikit-learn\nSHAP approach\n\nHyperparameter tuning on number of trees\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a random forest?\nThe decision tree model built last time was purely based on one model on its own, which often might not be as accurate or reflective in real-life. To improve the model, the average outcome from multiple models (Breiman 1998) should be considered to see if this would provide a more realistic image. This model averaging approach was also constantly used in our daily lives, for example, using majority votes during decision-making steps.\nThe same model averaging concept was also used in random forest (Breiman 2001), which as the name suggested, was composed of many decision trees (models) forming a forest. Each tree model would be making its own model prediction. By accruing multiple predictions since we have multiple trees, the average obtained from these predictions would produce one single result in the end. The advantage of this was that it improved the accuracy of the prediction by reducing variances, and also minimised the problem of overfitting the model if it was purely based on one model only (more details in section 1.11.2.1. Random Forests from scikit-learn).\nThe “random” part of the random forest was introduced in two ways. The first one was via using bootstrap samples, which was also known as bagging or bootstrap aggregating (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020), where samples were drawn with replacements within the training datasets for each tree built in the ensemble (also known as the perturb-and-combine technique (Breiman 1998)). While bootstrap sampling was happening, randomness was also incorporated into the training sets at the same time. The second way randomness was introduced was by using a random subset of features for splitting at the nodes, or a full set of features could also be used (although this was generally not recommended). The main goal here was to achieve best splits at each node.\n\n\n\nRandom forest in scikit-learn\nScikit-learn had two main types of random forest classes - ensemble.RandomForestClassifier() and ensemble.RandomForestRegressor(). When to use which class would depend on the target values. The easiest thing to do was to decide whether the target variables had class labels (binary types or non-continuous variables e.g. yes or no, or other different categories to be assigned) or continuous (numerical) variables, which in this case, if I were to continue using the same dataset from the decision tree series, it would be a continuous variable or feature, pKi, the inhibition constant.\nThere were also two other alternative random forest methods in scikit-learn, which were ensemble.RandomTreesEmbedding() and ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier() or ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor(). The difference for RandomTreesEmbedding() was that it was an unsupervised method that used data transformations (more details from section 1.11.2.6. on “Totally Random Trees Embedding” in scikit-learn). On the other side, there was also an option to use ExtraTreesClassifier() or ExtraTreesRegressor() to generate extremely randomised trees that would go for another level up in randomness (more deatils in section 1.11.2.2. on Extremely Randomized Trees from scikit-learn). The main difference for this type of random forest was that while there was already a random subset of feature selection used (with an intention to select the most discerning features), more randomness were added on top of this by using purely randomly generated splitting rules for picking features at the nodes. The advantage of this type of method was that it would reduce variance and increase the accuracy of the model, but the downside was there might be an increase in bias within the model.\n\n\n\nBuilding a random forest regressor model using scikit-learn\nAs usual, all the required libraries were imported first.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# For imbalanced datasets in regression \n# May need to set env variable (SKLEARN_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_SKLEARN_PACKAGE_INSTALL=True) when installing\n# due to package dependency on older sklearn version\nimport ImbalancedLearningRegression as iblr\n\n# Plots\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\n# Feature importances\n# Permutation_importance\nfrom sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance\n# SHAP values\nimport shap\n\n# Hyperparameter tuning\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, RepeatedKFold\n\nfrom numpy import mean, std\nfrom natsort import index_natsorted\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Showing version of scikit-learn used\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\n\n1.3.2\n\n\nImporting dataset that was preprocessed from last time - link to data source: first decision tree post.\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"ache_2d_chembl.csv\")\ndata.drop(columns = [\"Unnamed: 0\"], inplace=True)\n# Preparing data for compounds with max phase with \"NaN\" by re-labelling to \"null\"\ndata[\"max_phase\"].fillna(\"null\", inplace=True)\ndata.head()\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

This was kept the same as how it was in the decision tree posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s usually recommended to copy the original data or dataframe before doing any data manipulations to avoid unnecessary changes to the original dataset (this was not used in the decision tree posts, but since I’m going to use the same set of data again I’m doing it here.)\n\n\n\n# X variables (molecular

Now, when I reached this series on random forest, I realised I forgot to mention in the last series that data splitting was actually very crucial on model performance and could influence outcome predictions. It could also become quite complicated as more approaches were available to split the data. Also, the way the data was splitted could produce different outcomes.\nAfter I’ve splitted the same dataset based on compounds’ max phase assignments in ChEMBL and also fitted the training data on the random forest regressor, I went back and noticed that the training and testing data were very imbalanced and I probably should do something about it before fitting them onto another model.\nAt this stage, I went further to look into whether imbalanced datasets should be addressed in regression tasks, and did a surface search online. So based on common ML concensus, addressing imbalanced datasets were more applicable to classification tasks (e.g. binary labels or multi-class labels), rather than regression problems. However, recent ML research looked into the issue of imbalanced datasets in regression. This blog post mentioned a few studies that looked into this type of problem, and I thought they were very interesting and worth a mention at least. One of them that I’ve looked into was SMOTER, which was based on synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)(Chawla et al. 2002), and was named this way because it was basically a SMOTE for regression (hence SMOTER)(Torgo et al. 2013). Synthetic minority over-sampling technique for regression with Gaussian noise (SMOGN)(Kunz 2020) was another technique that was built upon SMOTER, but with Gaussian noises added. This has subsequently led me to ImbalancedLearningRegression library (Wu, Kunz, and Branco 2022), which was a variation of SMOGN. This was the one used on my imbalanced dataset, shown in the section below.\nA simple flow diagram was drawn below showing the evolution of different techniques when dealing with imbalanced datasets in classification (SMOTE) and regression (SMOTER, SMOGN and ImbalancedLearningRegression):\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(SMOTE) --&gt; B(SMOTER)\n  B --&gt; C(SMOGN)\n  C --&gt; D(ImbalancedLearningRegression)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub repository for ImbalancedLearningRegression package is available here, with its documentation available here.\nAlso, I just wanted to mention that these were not the only techniques available for treating imbalanced datasets in regression, as there were other ones in the literature and most likely more are being developed currently, but I only had time to cover these here for now.\nI also would like to mention another really useful open-source resource for treating imbalanced datasets in classifications since I did not use it in this post due to the problem being more of a regression one than a classification one - imbalance-learn library.\n\n# Original dataset - checking shape again\nprint(data.shape)\ndata.head()\n\n(481, 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\npKi\nmax_phase\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n8.787812\nnull\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n10.585027\nnull\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL95\n6.821023\n4.0\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\nCHEMBL173309\n7.913640\nnull\n694.539707\n0.666667\n8\n0\n2\n8\n50\n...\n2.803680\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\nCHEMBL1128\n6.698970\n4.0\n201.092042\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 25 columns\n\n\n\nSo my little test on using ImbalancedLearningRegression package started from below.\n\niblr_data = data.copy()\n\n# Introducing Gaussian noise for data sampling\ndata_gn = iblr.gn(data = iblr_data, y = \"pKi\", pert = 1)\nprint(data_gn.shape)\n\nsynth_matrix:   0%|          | 0/58 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  14%|#3        | 8/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 75.97it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  31%|###1      | 18/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 84.29it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  47%|####6     | 27/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 85.90it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  62%|######2   | 36/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 83.02it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  78%|#######7  | 45/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 83.24it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix:  93%|#########3| 54/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 84.17it/s]\n\n\nsynth_matrix: 100%|##########| 58/58 [00:00&lt;00:00, 84.10it/s]\n\n\n\n\n\nr_index:   0%|          | 0/8 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]\n\n\nr_index: 100%|##########| 8/8 [00:00&lt;00:00, 267.33it/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n(480, 25)\n\n\n\n# Followed by max phase split, where max phase 4 = training dataset\ndata_gn_mp4 = data_gn[data_gn[\"max_phase\"] == 4]\ndata_gn_mp4\nprint(data_gn_mp4.shape)\n\n(7, 25)\n\n\n\n# Also splitted max phase null compounds = testing dataset\ndata_gn_mp_null = data_gn[data_gn[\"max_phase\"] == \"null\"]\ndata_gn_mp_null\nprint(data_gn_mp_null.shape)\n\n(465, 25)\n\n\nThere were several different sampling techniques in ImbalancedLearningRegression package. I’ve only tried random over-sampling, under-sampling and Gaussian noise, but there were also other ones such as SMOTE and ADASYN (in over-sampling technique) or condensed nearest neighbor, Tomeklinks and edited nearest neightbour (in under-sampling technique) that I haven’t used.\nRandom over-sampling actually oversampled the max phase null compounds (sample size increased), while keeping all 10 max phase 4 compounds. Under-sampling removed all of the max phase 4 compounds (which was most likely not the best option, since I was aiming to use them as training compounds), with max phase null compounds also reduced in size too. Due to post length, I did not show the code for random over-sampling and under-sampling, but for people who are interested, I think it would be interesting to test them out.\nI ended up using Gauissian noise sampling and it reduced max phase 4 compounds slightly, and increased the max phase null compounds a little bit too, which seemed to be the most balanced data sampling at the first try. (Note: as stated from the documentation for ImbalancedLearningRegression package, missing values within features would be removed automatically, I’ve taken care of this in my last series of posts so no difference were observed here.)\nThe change in the distribution of pKi values for the Gaussian noise sampling method between the original and sample-modified datasets could be seen in the kernel density estimate plot below.

A scikit-learn explanation for this could be found in the section on “Permutation feature importance”. So the accuracy scores for the model were shown below.\n\n# Training set accuracy\nprint(f\"Random forest regressor training accuracy: {rfreg.score(X_mp4, y_mp4):.2f}\")\n\n# Testing set accuracy\nprint(f\"Random forest regressor testing accuracy: {rfreg.score(X_mp_test, y_mp_test):.2f}\")\n\nRandom forest regressor training accuracy: 0.86\nRandom forest regressor testing accuracy: 1.00\n\n\nIt looked like both the training and testing accuracies for the random forest regressor model (rfreg) were quite high, meaning that the model was able to remember the molecular features well from the training set (the tiny sample of 10 compounds), and the model was able to apply them to the testing set (which should contain about 400 or so compounds) as well, in order to make predictions on the target value of pKi. This has somewhat confirmed that the model was indeed making predictions, rather than not making any predictions at all, which meant there might be no point in finding out which features were important in the data. Therefore, we could now move onto processing the feature importances to fill in the bigger story i.e. which features were more pivotal towards influencing pKi values of approved drugs targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE).\nSimilar model accuracy scores were also generated for the iblr-gn modified dataset, which appeared to follow a similar pattern as the max phase-splitted dataset.\n\n# iblr-Gaussian noise & max phase splitted data\n# Training set accuracy\nprint(f\"Random forest regressor training accuracy: {rfreg_gn.score(X_mp4_gn, y_mp4_gn):.2f}\")\n\n# Testing set accuracy\nprint(f\"Random forest regressor testing accuracy: {rfreg_gn.score(X_mp_gn_test, y_mp_gn_test):.2f}\")\n\nRandom forest regressor training accuracy: 0.79\nRandom forest regressor testing accuracy: 1.00\n\n\nNow, setting up the y_true, which was the acutal pKi values of the testing set, and were converted into a NumPy array too.\n\ny_true = data_mp_null[\"pKi\"]\ny_true = y_true.to_numpy(copy=True)\n\nI also found out the mean squared error (MSE) between y_true (actual max phase null compounds’ pKi values) and y_pred (predicted max phase null compounds’ pKi values). When MSE was closer to zero, the better the model was, meaning less errors were present.\nSome references that might help with explaining MSE:\n\nscikit-learn link\nStats StackExchange link\nblog post link\n\n\n# For max phase splitted dataset only\nmean_squared_error(y_true, y_mp_test)\n\n2.3988097789702505\n\n\nWhen R2 (coefficient of determination) was closer to 1, the better the model is, with a usual range between 0 and 1 (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020). If it was negative, then the model might not be performing as well as expected. However, there could be exceptions as other model evaluation methods should also be interpreted together with R2 (a poor R2 might not be wholly indicating it’s a poor model).\nSome references that might help with understanding R2:\n\nStats StackExchange link\nscikit-learn link\n\n\n# For max phase splitted dataset only\nr2_score(y_true, y_mp_test)\n\n-0.16228227953132635\n\n\nBecause the data was re-sampled in a iblr-gn way, the size of array would be different from the original dataset, so here I’ve specifically grabbed pKi values from the iblr-gn modified data to get the actual pKi values for the max phase null compounds.\n\ny_true_gn = data_gn_mp_null[\"pKi\"]\ny_true_gn = y_true_gn.to_numpy(copy=True)\n\n\n# MSE for iblr-gn data\nmean_squared_error(y_true_gn, y_mp_gn_test)\n\n5.7895732090189185\n\n\n\n# R squared for iblr-gn data\nr2_score(y_true_gn, y_mp_gn_test)\n\n-0.7425920410726885\n\n\nWell, it appeared iblr-gn dataset might not offer much advantage than the original max phase splitted method. However, even the max phase splitted method wasn’t that great either, but it might still be interesting to find out which features were important in relation to the pKi values.\n\n\n\n\nFeature importances\nThere were two types of feature importances available in scikit-learn, which I’ve described below. I’ve also added a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach to this section as well to show different visualisation styles for feature importances on the same set of data.\n\n\nfeature_importances_ attribute from scikit-learn\nThe impurity-based feature importances (also known as Gini importance) were shown below.\n\n# Compute feature importances on rfreg training model\nfeature_imp = rfreg.feature_importances_\n\n\n# Check what feature_imp looks like (an array)\nfeature_imp\n\narray([0.0396524 , 0.06608031, 0.01129602, 0.09707957, 0.03625411,\n       0.04393835, 0.05287614, 0.03339396, 0.        , 0.14225505,\n       0.03562854, 0.16945464, 0.04450665, 0.02810539, 0.01437198,\n       0.0220527 , 0.02136604, 0.00803076, 0.04866529, 0.        ,\n       0.044468  , 0.04052409])\n\n\nI decided to write a function to convert a NumPy array into a plot below as this was also needed in the next section.\n\n# Function to convert array to df leading to plots \n# - for use in feature_importances_ & permutation_importance\n\ndef feat_imp_plot(feat_imp_array, X_df):\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to convert feature importance array into a dataframe, \n    which is then used to plot a bar graph \n    to show the feature importance ranking in the random forest model for the dataset used.\n\n    feat_imp_array is the array obtained from the feature_importances_ attribute, \n    after having a estimator/model fitted.\n\n    X_df is the dataframe for the X variable, \n    where the feature column names will be used in the plot.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Convert the feat_imp array into dataframe\n    feat_imp_df = pd.DataFrame(feat_imp_array)\n    \n    # Obtain feature names via column names of dataframe\n    # Rename the index as \"features\"\n    feature = X_df.columns.rename(\"features\")\n\n    # Convert the index to dataframe\n    feature_name_df = feature.to_frame(index = False)\n\n    # Concatenate feature_imp_df & feature_name_df\n    feature_df = pd.concat(\n        [feat_imp_df, feature_name_df], \n        axis=1\n        ).rename(\n            # Rename the column for feature importances\n            columns = {0: \"feature_importances\"}\n            ).sort_values(\n                # Sort values of feature importances in descending order\n                \"feature_importances\", ascending=False\n                )\n    \n    # Seaborn bar plot\n    sns.barplot(\n        feature_df, \n        x = \"feature_importances\", \n        y = \"features\")\n\n\n# Testing feat_imp_plot function\nfeat_imp_plot(feature_imp, X_mp4_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative way to plot was via Matplotlib directly (note: Seaborn was built based on Matplotlib, so the plots were pretty similar). The code below were probably a bit more straightforward but without axes named and the values were not sorted (only as an example but more code could be added to do this).\n\n# Matplotlib plot\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.barh(X_mp4_df.columns, rfreg.feature_importances_)\n\n&lt;BarContainer object of 22 artists&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npermutation_importance function from scikit-learn\nThere were known issues with the built-in feature_importances_ attribute in scikit-learn. As quoted from scikit-learn on feature importance evaluation:\n\n… The impurity-based feature importances computed on tree-based models suffer from two flaws that can lead to misleading conclusions. First they are computed on statistics derived from the training dataset and therefore do not necessarily inform us on which features are most important to make good predictions on held-out dataset. Secondly, they favor high cardinality features, that is features with many unique values. Permutation feature importance is an alternative to impurity-based feature importance that does not suffer from these flaws. …\n\nSo I’ve also tried the permutation_importance function (a model-agnostic method).\n\nperm_result = permutation_importance(rfreg, X_mp_test, y_mp_test, n_repeats=10, random_state=1, n_jobs=2)\n\n# Checking data type of perm_result\ntype(perm_result)\n\nsklearn.utils._bunch.Bunch\n\n\nIt normally returns a dictionary-like objects (e.g. Bunch) with the following 3 attributes:\n\nimportances_mean (mean of feature importances)\nimportances_std (standard deviation of feature importances)\nimportances (raw permutation/feature importances scores)\n\nFor details on these attributes, this scikit-learn link will add a bit more explanations.\nI decided to only use importances_mean for now.\n\nperm_imp = perm_result.importances_mean\n\n# Confirm it produces an array\ntype(perm_imp)\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\n\n# Using the function feat_imp_plot() on perm_imp result to show plot\nfeat_imp_plot(perm_imp, X_mp4_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt generated a different feature importances ranking (if looking at top 6 features), although somewhat similar to the previous one.\n\n\n\nSHAP approach\nSHAP values (Lundberg et al. 2020), (Shapley et al. 1953) were used here to provide another way to figure out feature importances. The GitHub repository for this SHAP approach could be accessed here.\nSHAP’s TreeExplainer() was based on Tree SHAP algorithms (Lundberg et al. 2020), and was used to show and explain feature importances within tree models. It could also be extended to boosted tree models such as LightGBM and XGBoost and also other tree models (as explained by the GitHub repository README.md and its documentation link provided). It was also a model-agnostic method, which could be quite handy.\nOther reference\n\nshap_explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rfreg)\n\n# X_test needs to be a dataframe (not numpy array)\n# otherwise feature names won't show in plot\nshap_values = shap_explainer.shap_values(X_mp_test_df)\n\n# Horizontal bar plot\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_mp_test_df, plot_type = \"bar\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDot plot version:\n\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_mp_test_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot:\n\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_mp_test_df, plot_type = \"violin\")\n\n# Alternative plot option: \"layered_violin\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperparameter tuning\nAn example was shown below on tuning the number of trees (n_estimators) used in the random forest model.\n\n# Function code adapted with thanks from ML Mastery \n# https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-forest-ensemble-in-python/\n\n# ---Evaluate a list of models with different number of trees---\n\n# Define dataset by using the same training dataset as above\nX, y = X_mp4, y_mp4\n\n# Define function to generate a list of models with different no. of trees\ndef models():\n    # Create empty dictionary (key, value pairs) for models\n    models = dict()\n    # Test different number of trees to evaluate\n    no_trees = [50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]\n    for n in no_trees:\n        models[str(n)] = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=n)\n    return models\n\n\n# Define function to evaluate a single model using cross-validation\ndef evaluate(model, X, y):\n\n    # RepeatedStratifiedKFold usually for binary or multi-class labels \n    # - ref link: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.KFold\n    # so using ReaptedKFold instead\n    cross_val = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=15, random_state=1)\n    # Run evaluation process & collect cv scores\n    # Since estimator/model was based on DecisionTreeRegressor, \n    # using neg_mean_squared_error metric\n    # n_jobs = -1 meaning using all processors to run jobs in parallel\n    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring=\"neg_mean_squared_error\", cv=cross_val, n_jobs=-1)\n    return scores\n\n\n# Evaluate results\n# Run models with different RepeatedKFold & different no. of tress\n# with results shown as diff. trees with calculated mean cv scores & std\n\n# Obtain diff. models with diff. trees via models function\nmodels = models()\n\n# Create empty lists for results & names\nresults, names = list(), list()\n\n# Create a for loop to iterate through the list of diff. models\nfor name, model in models.items():\n    # Run the cross validation scores via evaluate function\n    scores = evaluate(model, X, y)\n    # Collect results\n    results.append(scores)\n    # Collect names (different no. of trees)\n    names.append(name)\n    # Show the average mean squared errors and corresponding standard deviations \n    # for each model with diff. no. of trees\n    print((name, mean(scores), std(scores)))\n\n('50', -1.6470594650953017, 1.6444082604560304)\n\n\n('100', -1.6995136024743887, 1.6797340671624852)\n\n\n('250', -1.6716290617106646, 1.6236808789148038)\n\n\n('500', -1.645981936868625, 1.615445700037851)\n\n\n('1000', -1.6532678610618743, 1.604259597928101)\n\n\nThe negated version of the mean squared error (neg_mean_squared_error) was due to how the scoring parameter source code was written in scikit-learn. It was written this way to take into account of both scoring and loss functions (links provided below for further explanations). All scoring metrics could be accessed here for scikit-learn.\nReference links to help with understanding neg_mean_squared_error:\n\nscikit-learn source code\nStackOverflow answer\n\nAlso, the random forest algorithm was stochastic in nature, meaning that every time hyperparameter tuning took place, it would generate different scores due to random bootstrap sampling. The best approach to evaluate model performance during the cross-validation process was to use the average outcome from several runs of cross-validations, then fit the hyperparameters on a final model, or getting several final models ready and then obtaining the average from these models instead.\nBelow was a version of boxplot plotted using Matplotlib showing the differences in the distributions of the cross validation scores and mean squared errors between different number of trees.\n\nplt.boxplot(results, labels=names, showmeans=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot this in Seaborn, I had to prepare the data slightly differently to achieve a different version of the boxplot. Matplotlib was a bit more straightforward to use without these steps.\nI also used natural sort to sort numerical values (GitHub repository). Otherwise, if using sort_values() only, it would only sort the numbers in lexicographical order (i.e. by first digit only), which was not able to show the tree numbers in ascending order.\n\n# Combine results & names lists into dataframe\ncv_results = pd.DataFrame(results, index = [names])\n\n\n# Reset index and rename the number of trees column\ncv_results = cv_results.reset_index().rename(columns={\"level_0\": \"Number_of_trees\"})\n\n\n# Melt the dataframe by number of trees column\ncv_results = cv_results.melt(id_vars=\"Number_of_trees\")\n\n\n# Sort by the number of trees column\ncv_results = cv_results.sort_values(\n    by=\"Number_of_trees\",\n    key=lambda x: np.argsort(index_natsorted(cv_results[\"Number_of_trees\"]))\n)\n\n\n# Seaborn boxplot\nsns.boxplot(cv_results, x=\"Number_of_trees\", y=\"value\", showmeans=True)\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='Number_of_trees', ylabel='value'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seaborn boxplot shown should be very similar to the Matplotlib one.\nOther hyperparameters that could be tuned included:\n\ntree depths (max_depth)\nnumber of samples (max_samples)\nnumber of features (max_features) - I didn’t use RDKit to generate molecular features for this post (Datamol version was used instead) which would provide around 209 at least (trying to keep the post at a readable length), but I think this might be a better option when doing cross-validations in model evaluations\nnumber of nodes (max_leaf_nodes)\n\nI’ve decided not to code for these other hyperparameters in the cross-validation step due to length of post (the function code used in cross-validation above could be further adapted to cater for other hyperparameters mentioned here), but they should be looked into if doing full-scale and comprehensive ML using the ensemble random forest algorithm.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nRandom forest was known to be a black-box ML algorithm (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020), which was completely different from the white-box ML style revealed in decision tree graphs. Feature importances was therefore crucial to shed some lights and remove some layers of the black-box nature in random forest by showing which features were contributing towards model accuracy by ranking features used to train the model. Cross-validation was also vital to avoid over-fitting (which was more applicable to depth of trees), although in some other cases (e.g. number of trees), it was mentioned that it was unlikely the model would be overfitted. Other options available in scikit-learn ensemble methods that I didn’t get time to try were using voting classifier/regressor and stacking models to reduce biases in models, which might be very useful in other cases.\nFew things I’ve thought of that I could try to improve what I did here was that I should really look for a different set of testing data, rather than using the max phase splits, which was not that ideal. However, as a lot of us are aware, good drug discovery data are hard to come by (a long-standing and complicated problem), I probably need some luck while looking for a different set of drug discovery data later. Another approach that I could try was that I could use RandomForestClassifier() instead on max phase prediction of these small molecules, rather than making pKi value predictions. This might involve re-labelling the max phases for these compounds into a binary or class labels, then I could use the imbalance-learn package to try and alleviate the problem with imbalanced datasets. Nevertheless, I had some fun working on this post and learnt a lot while doing it, and I hope some of the readers might find this post helpful or informative at least.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nI’d like to thank all the authors, developers and contributors who worked towards all of the open-source packages or libraries used in this post.

    "text": "This post has been updated since October 2024 (separated into four shorter posts) using only Polars dataframe library (the older version uses both Polars and Pandas):\n1st post - Parquet file in Polars dataframe library\n2nd post - Preprocessing data in Polars dataframe library\n3rd post - Building logistic regression model using scikit-learn\n4th post - Evaluating logistic regression model in scikit-learn\n\n\nMachine learning in drug discovery - series 1.1\n\n*Latest update from 19th April 2024 - Polars is currently more integrated with Scikit-learn from version 1.4 (since January 2024), see this link re. Polars output in set_output for Polars dataframe outputs in Scikit-learn, and also a few other Polars enhancements from release version 1.4 changelog.\nPrevious post update was on 16th August 2023 - some code updates only, please always refer to Polars API reference documentations for most up-to-date code.\n\n\n\nBackground\nAs my interests gradually grew for Rust, I realised why so many people said it might be a hard programming language to learn. My head was spinning after reading the Rust programming language book and watching a few online teaching videos about it. I then decided to start from something I was more familiar with, and somehow through various online ventures and searching, I’ve managed to start two projects in parallel. The first one was where I used Polars dataframe library, and the second one would be about using Rust through an interactive user interface such as Jupyter notebook. I’ve anticipated that the second project would take much longer time for me to finish, so I would be tackling the first project for now.\nThis project was about using Polars, a blazingly fast dataframe library that was written completely in Rust with a very light Python binding that was available for use via Python or Rust, so I started using Polars via Python on Jupyter Lab initially, which involved data wrangling, some exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a reasonably larger section on using machine learning (ML) through scikit-learn. The editing and publishing of this post was mainly achieved via RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\nInstall Polars\n\n# To install Polars dataframe library\n# Uncomment below to download and install Polars\n#!pip install polars\n\n# Update Polars version\n# Uncomment the line below to update Polars\n#!pip install --upgrade polars\n\nOnce Polars was installed, the next step was to import it for use.\n\nimport polars as pl\n\n\n# Show version of Polars\n# Uncomment line below to check version of Polars installed/updated\n#pl.show_versions()\n\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nThe dataset, which was purely about small molecules and their physicochemical properties, was downloaded from ChEMBL database and saved as a .csv file. I’ve decided not to upload the “chembl_mols.csv” file due to its sheer size (around 0.6 GB), and also I’d like to stay using free open-source resources (including GitHub) at this stage. I’ve looked into the Git large file system, but for the free version it only provides 2 GB, which at this stage, I think by adding this larger than usual .csv file along with my portfolio blog repository may exceed this limit in no time.\nFor anyone who would like to use the same dataset, the file I used would be equivalent to a straight download from the home page of ChEMBL database, via clicking on the “Distinct compounds” (please see the circled area in the image below). Options were available to download the files as .csv, .tsv or .sdf formats (located at the top right of the page).\n\n\n\n\nImage adapted from ChEMBL database website\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve had the file ready, it would be read via the usual read_csv() method.\n\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"chembl_mols.csv\")\ndf.head() #read first 5 rows\n#df #read full dataset\n\n\nshape: (5, 1)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\";\"Name\";\"Synonyms\";\"Type\";\"Max Phase\";\"Molecular Weight\";\"Targets\";\"Bioactivities\";\"AlogP\";\"Polar Surface Area\";\"HBA\";\"HBD\";\"#RO5 Violations\";\"#Rotatable Bonds\";\"Passes Ro3\";\"QED Weighted\";\"CX Acidic pKa\";\"CX Basic pKa\";\"CX LogP\";\"CX LogD\";\"Aromatic Rings\";\"Structure Type\";\"Inorganic Flag\";\"Heavy Atoms\";\"HBA (Lipinski)\";\"HBD (Lipinski)\";\"#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\";\"Molecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\";\"Molecular Species\";\"Molecular Formula\";\"Smiles\";\"Inchi Key\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1206185;\";\";Small molecu…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL539070;\";\";Small molecul…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3335528;\";\";Small molecu…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2419030;\";\";Small molecu…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4301448;\";\";Small molecu…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nNow, since this dataset was downloaded as a .csv file, this meant it was likely to have a certain delimiter between each variable. So the whole dataset was presented as strings where each string represented each compound in each row. Each variable was separated by semicolons. To read it properly, I’ve added a delimiter term in the code to transform the dataframe into a more readable format.\n\n# By referring to Polars documentation, \n# *use \"sep\" to set the delimiter of the file\n# which was semicolons in this case\n# *please note this has been updated to \"separator\" \n# due to updates in Polars since the published date of this post\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"chembl_mols.csv\", separator = \";\")\n# Show the first 10 rows of data\n#df.head(10)\n# or full dataset\ndf\n\n\nshape: (2_331_700, 32)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nName\nSynonyms\nType\nMax Phase\nMolecular Weight\nTargets\nBioactivities\nAlogP\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\n#Rotatable Bonds\nPasses Ro3\nQED Weighted\nCX Acidic pKa\nCX Basic pKa\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nAromatic Rings\nStructure Type\nInorganic Flag\nHeavy Atoms\nHBA (Lipinski)\nHBD (Lipinski)\n#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\nMolecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\nMolecular Species\nMolecular Formula\nSmiles\nInchi Key\n\n\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\ni64\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\ni64\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1206185\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"607.88\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"9.46\"\n\"89.62\"\n\"5\"\n\"2\"\n\"2\"\n\"17\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.09\"\n\"-1.91\"\n\"8.38\"\n\"9.40\"\n\"9.36\"\n\"3\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"42\"\n\"5\"\n\"3\"\n\"2\"\n\"607.2790\"\n\"ACID\"\n\"C35H45NO4S2\"\n\"CCCCCCCCCCC#CC(N)c1ccccc1-c1cc…\n\"UFBLKYIDZFRLPR-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL539070\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"286.79\"\n\"1\"\n\"1\"\n\"2.28\"\n\"73.06\"\n\"6\"\n\"2\"\n\"0\"\n\"5\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.63\"\n\"13.84\"\n\"3.64\"\n\"2.57\"\n\"2.57\"\n\"2\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"17\"\n\"5\"\n\"3\"\n\"0\"\n\"250.0888\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C11H15ClN4OS\"\n\"CCCOc1ccccc1-c1nnc(NN)s1.Cl\"\n\"WPEWNRKLKLNLSO-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3335528\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"842.80\"\n\"2\"\n\"6\"\n\"0.18\"\n\"269.57\"\n\"18\"\n\"5\"\n\"2\"\n\"17\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.09\"\n\"3.20\"\n\"None\"\n\"3.31\"\n\"-0.14\"\n\"3\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"60\"\n\"19\"\n\"5\"\n\"2\"\n\"842.2633\"\n\"ACID\"\n\"C41H46O19\"\n\"COC(=O)[C@H](O[C@@H]1O[C@@H](C…\n\"KGUJQZWYZPYYRZ-LWEWUKDVSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2419030\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"359.33\"\n\"4\"\n\"4\"\n\"3.94\"\n\"85.13\"\n\"6\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"3\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.66\"\n\"None\"\n\"None\"\n\"3.66\"\n\"3.66\"\n\"2\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"24\"\n\"6\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"359.0551\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C14H12F3N3O3S\"\n\"O=c1nc(NC2CCCC2)sc2c([N+](=O)[…\n\"QGDMYSDFCXOKML-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4301448\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"465.55\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"5.09\"\n\"105.28\"\n\"6\"\n\"4\"\n\"1\"\n\"10\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.15\"\n\"None\"\n\"12.14\"\n\"4.41\"\n\"2.00\"\n\"4\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"33\"\n\"7\"\n\"5\"\n\"1\"\n\"465.1635\"\n\"BASE\"\n\"C24H24FN5O2S\"\n\"N=C(N)NCCCOc1ccc(CNc2nc3ccc(Oc…\n\"RXTJPHLPHOZLFS-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2017916\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"312.35\"\n\"3\"\n\"3\"\n\"2.86\"\n\"77.00\"\n\"6\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"4\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.80\"\n\"8.13\"\n\"3.49\"\n\"2.17\"\n\"2.10\"\n\"3\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"22\"\n\"6\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"312.0681\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C15H12N4O2S\"\n\"COc1ccc(-c2nnc(NC(=O)c3cccnc3)…\n\"XIZUJGDKNPVNQA-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL374652\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"403.83\"\n\"1\"\n\"1\"\n\"5.98\"\n\"36.02\"\n\"2\"\n\"2\"\n\"1\"\n\"4\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.42\"\n\"13.65\"\n\"None\"\n\"5.36\"\n\"5.36\"\n\"3\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"26\"\n\"2\"\n\"2\"\n\"1\"\n\"403.0421\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C18H14ClF4NOS\"\n\"CC(O)(CSc1ccc(F)cc1)c1cc2cc(Cl…\n\"CRPQTBRTHURKII-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1416264\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"380.41\"\n\"6\"\n\"8\"\n\"3.06\"\n\"85.07\"\n\"7\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"5\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.54\"\n\"13.85\"\n\"3.86\"\n\"2.47\"\n\"2.47\"\n\"4\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"27\"\n\"7\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"380.0856\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C18H13FN6OS\"\n\"O=C(CSc1ccc2nnc(-c3cccnc3)n2n1…\n\"QVYIEKHEJKFNAT-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL213734\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"288.26\"\n\"2\"\n\"3\"\n\"2.32\"\n\"101.70\"\n\"5\"\n\"2\"\n\"0\"\n\"5\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.50\"\n\"7.20\"\n\"None\"\n\"2.36\"\n\"1.95\"\n\"2\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"21\"\n\"7\"\n\"2\"\n\"0\"\n\"288.0746\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C14H12N2O5\"\n\"O=C(COc1ccccc1)Nc1ccc([N+](=O)…\n\"PZTWAHGBGTWVEB-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1531634\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n\"320.16\"\n\"19\"\n\"21\"\n\"4.40\"\n\"29.10\"\n\"2\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"4\"\n\"N\"\n\"0.67\"\n\"None\"\n\"None\"\n\"4.04\"\n\"4.04\"\n\"2\"\n\"MOL\"\n-1\n\"19\"\n\"2\"\n\"1\"\n\"0\"\n\"319.0008\"\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C15H11BrFNO\"\n\"O=C(/C=C/Nc1ccc(F)cc1)c1ccc(Br…\n\"DKPWCCDDKFLKEC-MDZDMXLPSA-N\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, I only wanted to download around 24 compounds from the ChEMBL database first. Unknowingly, I ended up downloading the whole curated set of 2,331,700 small molecules (!), and I found this out when I loaded the dataframe after setting up the delimiter for the csv file, which later led to the file size problem mentioned earlier.\nLoading these 2,331,700 rows of data was fast, which occurred within a few seconds without exaggeration. This echoed many users’ experiences with Polars, so this was another nice surprise, and once again confirmed that Rust, and also Apache arrow, which was used as Polars’ foundation, were solid in speed.\nNow I had the full dataframe, and I wanted to find out what types of physicochemical properties were there for the compounds.\n\n# Print all column names and data types \nprint(df.glimpse())\n\nRows: 2331700\nColumns: 32\n$ ChEMBL ID                       &lt;str&gt;

This took a while and was an important step to take so that I would know what to do when reaching the ML phase.\nI have selected a few physicochemical properties down below so that readers and I could gather some reasonable understandings for each term. The explanations for each term were adapted from ChEMBL_31 schema documentation (available as “Release notes” on the website), or if definitions for certain terms were not available from the documentation, I resorted to interpret them myself by going into “Dinstict compounds” section on the ChEMBL database, where I would click on, e.g. bioactivities, for a random compound in there to see what results showed up and then described them below.\nThe definitions for some of the listed physicochemical properties were:\nMax Phase - Maximum phase of development reached for the compound (where 4 = approved). Null was where max phase has not yet been assigned.\nBioactivities - Various biological assays used for the compounds e.g. IC50, GI50, potency tests etc.\nAlogP - Calculated partition coefficient\nHBA - Number of hydrogen bond acceptors\nHBD - Number of hydrogen bond donors\n#RO5 Violations - Number of violations of Lipinski’s rule-of-five, using HBA and HBD definitions\nPasses Ro3 - Indicated whether the compound passed the rule-of-three (MW &lt; 300, logP &lt; 3 etc)\nQED Weighted - Weighted quantitative estimate of drug likeness (as defined by Bickerton et al., Nature Chem 2012)\nInorganic flag - Indicated whether the molecule was inorganic (i.e., containing only metal atoms and &lt;2 carbon atoms), where 1 = inorganic compound and -1 = not inorganic compound (assuming 0 meant it was neither case or yet to be assigned)\nHeavy Atoms - Number of heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms\nCX Acidic pKa - The most acidic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX Basic pKa - The most basic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogP - The calculated octanol/water partition coefficient using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogD - The calculated octanol/water distribution coefficient at pH = 7.4 using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nStructure Type - based on compound_structures table, where SEQ indicated an entry in the protein_therapeutics table instead, NONE indicated an entry in neither tables, e.g. structure unknown\nInchi Key - the IUPAC international chemical identifier key\nFrom the df.glimpse() method previously, there were a lot of columns with the data type of “Utf8”, which meant they were strings. There were only two columns that had “Int64”, which meant they were integers. A lot of these columns were actually storing numbers as strings. So to make my life easier, I went on to convert these data types into the more appropriate ones for selected columns.\n\n# Convert data types for multiple selected columns\n# Note: only takes two

exploratory data analysis\nOne of the columns that jumped out from the summary statistics of the df_dn dataset was the “Targets” column. It ranged from 1 to 1334 targets. Out of curiosity, I went through several places on ChEMBL website to find out the exact definition of “Target”. Eventually I settled on an answer which explained that the “Target” column represented the number of targets associated with the particular ChEMBL compound listed. I then singled out the ChEMBL compound with 1334 targets recorded, it turned out to be imatinib, which was marketed as Gleevec, and was a well-known prescription medicine for leukaemia and other selected oncological disorders with many well-documented drug interactions.\n\n# This was confirmed via a filter function, which brought up CHEMBL1421, or also known as dasatinib\ndf_dn.filter(pl.col(\"Targets\") == 1334)\n\n\nshape: (1, 32)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nName\nSynonyms\nType\nMax Phase\nMolecular Weight\nTargets\nBioactivities\nAlogP\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\n#Rotatable Bonds\nPasses Ro3\nQED Weighted\nCX Acidic pKa\nCX Basic pKa\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nAromatic Rings\nStructure Type\nInorganic Flag\nHeavy Atoms\nHBA (Lipinski)\nHBD (Lipinski)\n#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\nMolecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\nMolecular Species\nMolecular Formula\nSmiles\nInchi Key\n\n\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\ni64\nf64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nstr\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\nstr\ni64\ni64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nstr\nstr\nstr\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL941\"\n\"IMATINIB\"\n\"GLAMOX|Gleevec|IMATINIB|Imatin…\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n493.62\n1334\n4359\n4.59\n86.28\n7\n2\n0\n7\n\"N\"\n0.39\n12.69\n7.84\n4.38\n3.8\n4\n\"MOL\"\n0\n37\n8\n2\n0\n493.259\n\"NEUTRAL\"\n\"C29H31N7O\"\n\"Cc1ccc(NC(=O)c2ccc(CN3CCN(C)CC…\n\"KTUFNOKKBVMGRW-UHFFFAOYSA-N\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore other physicochemical and molecular properties in the dataframe, “Max Phase” was one of the first few that drew my interests. So it tagged each ChEMBL compound with a max phase number from 0 to 4, where 4 meant the compound was approved (usually also meant it was already a prescription medicine). Thinking along this line, I thought what about those compounds that had max phase as 0, because they were the ones still pending associations with max phase numbers. By extending on this idea, this could be a good opportunity to introduce some ML to predict whether these zero max phase compounds would enter the approved max phase.\nFirstly, I had a look at the overall distribution of the max phase compounds in this dataframe df_dn.\n\n# Interested in what types of \"Max Phase\" were recorded \n# for the curated small molecules in ChEMBL database\ndf_dn.group_by(\"Max Phase\", maintain_order = True).agg(pl.count())\n\n/var/folders/0y/p72zn_cx4vz1lv6zmyd7gkt00000gn/T/ipykernel_2417/3278305966.py:3: DeprecationWarning: `pl.count()` is deprecated. Please use `pl.len()` instead.\n  df_dn.group_by(\"Max Phase\", maintain_order = True).agg(pl.count())\n\n\n\nshape: (5, 2)\n\n\n\nMax Phase\ncount\n\n\ni64\nu32\n\n\n\n\n0\n734633\n\n\n3\n303\n\n\n4\n954\n\n\n2\n441\n\n\n1\n239\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick groupby function showed that there were only 954 small molecules approved. Phase 3 recorded a total of 303 small molecules. For phase 2, there were 441 small molecules, followed by 239 compounds in phase 1. There were, however, a total amount of 734,633 small molecules that had zero as phase number (as per ChEMBL_31 schema documentation). Note: these figures were only for ChEMBL compounds with full documentations in the dataset (excluding entries or compounds with N/A or “” (empty) string cells).\nOne of the other parameters I was interested in was “QED Weighted”. So I went further into understanding what it meant, as the original reference was conveniently provided in the ChEMBL_31 schema documentation. The reference paper was by Bickerton, G., Paolini, G., Besnard, J. et al. Quantifying the chemical beauty of drugs. Nature Chem 4, 90–98 (2012) (note: author’s manuscript was available to view via PubMed link, the Nature Chemistry link only provided abstract with access to article via other means as stated).\nIn short, it was a measure of druglikeness for small molecules based on the concept of desirability, which was based on a total of 8 different molecular properties. These molecular properties included molecular weight, ALogP, polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings and structural alerts. Without going into too much details for this QED Weighted parameter, it was normally recorded as a number that ranged from 0 to 1, with 0 being the least druglike and 1 being the most druglike.\n\n\n\nPrepare dataframe prior to running machine learning model\nBefore I got too carried away with further EDA, I wanted to get started on preparing a dataframe for the ML model. A rough plan at this stage was to filter out Max Phase 4 and 0 compounds. Max phase 0 compounds were the ones that were not assigned with any max phase numbers yet, so they would be ideal for use as the testing set. Another main idea was to use “Max Phase” parameter as the target y variable for a LR model, because ultimately stakeholders would be more interested in knowing which candidate compounds had the most likely chance to reach the final approved phase during a drug discovery and development project or otherwise. This would also provide a chance to potentially reduce the amount of resources and time required in such a complex and sophisticated matter.\nThe goal of this ML model was to answer this question: which physicochemical parameters would be the most suitable ones to predict whether a compound would enter max phase 4 (approved) or not? (implicitly, this might also help to predict which max phase 0 compounds would likely enter max phase 4 in the end)\nI’ve then narrowed down the df_dn dataset to fulfill the following criteria:\n\nOnly small molecules present\nMax phase of 0 and 4 only\n\nAnother reason behind choosing only small molecules that had max phase of 0 and 4 was that a confusion matrix could be built in the end to see if the parameters selected would give us a reasonably good model for predicting the outcomes of these small molecules.\nFor now, I’ve chosen the following columns (or physicochemical parameters) to appear in the interim df_0 and df_4 datasets.\n\n# Selecting Max phase 0 small molecules with desired parameters\ndf_0 = df_dn.filter(\n    (pl.col(\"Type\") == \"Small molecule\") &\n    (pl.col(\"Max Phase\") == 0)\n).select([\"ChEMBL ID\", \n          \"Type\", \n          \"Max Phase\",\n          \"#RO5 Violations\", \n          \"QED Weighted\", \n          \"CX LogP\", \n          \"CX LogD\", \n          \"Heavy Atoms\"]\n        )\ndf_0\n\n\nshape: (612_795, 8)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nType\nMax Phase\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\nstr\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL539070\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.63\n2.57\n2.57\n17\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3827271\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n2\n0.07\n-6.88\n-8.95\n50\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3824158\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n1\n0.31\n2.49\n2.42\n31\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1991010\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n1\n0.6\n6.34\n5.22\n31\n\n\n\"CHEMBL195644\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.73\n3.92\n3.91\n28\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2419480\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.59\n2.14\n1.2\n32\n\n\n\"CHEMBL540121\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n1\n0.22\n-0.75\n-0.78\n36\n\n\n\"CHEMBL374041\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n1\n0.28\n2.17\n1.33\n37\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2017916\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.8\n2.17\n2.1\n22\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1416264\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.54\n2.47\n2.47\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Selecting Max phase 4 small molecules with desired parameters\ndf_4 = df_dn.filter(\n    (pl.col(\"Type\") == \"Small molecule\") &\n    (pl.col(\"Max Phase\") == 4)\n).select([\"ChEMBL ID\", \n          \"Type\", \n          \"Max Phase\",\n          \"#RO5 Violations\", \n          \"QED Weighted\", \n          \"CX LogP\", \n          \"CX LogD\", \n          \"Heavy Atoms\"]\n        )\ndf_4\n\n\nshape: (944, 8)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nType\nMax Phase\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\nstr\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1096882\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.31\n-1.97\n-5.12\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2023898\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n2\n0.14\n4.18\n4.16\n54\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1029\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.46\n-1.18\n-2.3\n15\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1616\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.72\n2.88\n2.58\n20\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2146123\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n1\n0.33\n-3.51\n-3.81\n32\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3545062\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n2\n0.1\n5.57\n5.57\n65\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3039520\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.83\n3.3\n2.61\n27\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1198857\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.26\n3.6\n1.93\n32\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2146133\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.77\n2.43\n2.43\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1619785\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n4\n0\n0.49\n2.09\n1.86\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-sampling via under-sampling\nBecause of the large number of Max Phase 0 compounds present in the original dataset, I’ve randomly sampled about 950 small molecules from this group, so that there were similar amount of data in each group to avoid having an imbalanced dataset.\n\ndf_s_0 = df_0.sample(n = 950, shuffle = True, seed = 0)\ndf_s_0\n\n\nshape: (950, 8)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nType\nMax Phase\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\nstr\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1381048\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.66\n1.25\n1.24\n20\n\n\n\"CHEMBL14441\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.71\n3.29\n3.28\n17\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3916046\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n1\n0.38\n1.29\n1.28\n37\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1091700\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n2\n0.29\n3.27\n3.13\n45\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4109628\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.55\n3.52\n3.52\n34\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3261532\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.78\n2.99\n-0.35\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3343507\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.5\n2.18\n0.03\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1720477\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.92\n2.34\n-0.74\n21\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4293746\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.48\n2.61\n2.54\n29\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3219994\"\n\"Small molecule\"\n0\n0\n0.83\n4.46\n4.18\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the plan was to use LR method for ML model, the y variable I was interested in was going to be a binary categorical variable - meaning it needed to be 0 (not approved) or 1 (approved).

One major advantage of using pipeline was that it was designed to chain all the estimators used for ML. The benefit of this was that we only had to call fit and predict once in our data to fit the whole chain of estimators. The other useful thing was that this could avoid data leakage from our testing set into the training set by making sure the same set of samples were used to train the transformers and predictors. One other key thing it also helped was that it also avoided the possibility of missing out on the transformation step.\nThe example below used the function of make_pipeline, which took in a number of estimators as inputted, and then constructed a pipeline based on them.\n\n# Test pipline from scikit-Learn\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nLR = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LogisticRegression())\nLR.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nPipeline(steps=[('standardscaler', StandardScaler()),\n                ('logisticregression', LogisticRegression())])In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

Accuracy literally provided a measure of how close the predicted samples were to the true values. One caveat to note was that for imbalanced dataset, accuracy score might not be very informative, and other evaluation metrics would need to be considered instead.\nThe accuracy score shown below was from the pipeline method used previously, which showed a very similar accuracy score of 0.69656992 (close to 0.7), confirming the method was in line with the original preprocessing method.\n\nLR.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.6965699208443272\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion matrix\nNext, I’ve built a confusion matrix based on the model in order to visualise the counts of correct and incorrect predictions. The function code used below was adapted from the IBM data science course I’ve taken around the end of last year. I’ve added comments to try and explain what each section of the code meant.\n\n# Import confusion matrix from scikit-learn\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n# Import itertools - functions to create iterators for efficient looping\nimport itertools\n\n# Function to print and plot confusion matrix\ndef plot_confusion_matrix(# Sets a cm object (cm = confusion matrix)\n                          cm, \n                          # Sets classes of '1s' (Successes) & '0s' (Non-successes) for the cm\n                          classes,\n                          # If setting normalize = true, reports in ratios instead of counts\n                          normalize,\n                          title = 'Confusion matrix',\n                          # Choose colour of the cm (using colourmap recognised by matplotlib)\n                          cmap = plt.cm.Reds):\n    \n    if normalize:\n        cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis = 1)[:, np.newaxis]\n        print(\"Normalized confusion matrix\")\n    else:\n        print('Confusion matrix, without normalization')\n\n    print(cm)\n\n    # Plot the confusion matrix \n    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation = 'nearest', cmap = cmap)\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.colorbar()\n    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation = 45)\n    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)\n\n    # Floats to be round up to two decimal places if using normalize = True\n    # or else use integers\n    fmt = '.2f' if normalize else 'd'\n    # Sets threshold of 0.5\n    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    # Iterate through the results and differentiate between two text colours \n    # by using the threshold as a cut-off\n    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt),\n                 horizontalalignment = \"center\",\n                 color = \"white\" if cm[i, j] &gt; thresh else \"black\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.ylabel('True label')\n    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')\n\n\n# Compute confusion matrix\nmatrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_mp, labels = [0,1])\nnp.set_printoptions(precision = 2)\n\n# Plot confusion matrix without normalisation\nplt.figure()\nplot_confusion_matrix(matrix, \n                      # Define classes of outcomes\n                      classes = ['Max_Phase = 0','Max_Phase = 1'], \n                      # Set normalize = True if wanting ratios instead\n                      normalize = False, \n                      title = \"Confusion matrix without normalisation\"\n                     )\n\nConfusion matrix, without normalization\n[[143  59]\n [ 54 123]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common rule of thumb for confusion matrix was that all predicted outcomes were columns and all the true outcomes were rows. However, there might be exceptions where this was the other way round. Four different categories could be seen in the confusion matrix which were:\n\nTrue positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 1 (126 out of 189 samples)\nTrue negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 0 (139 out of 190 samples)\nFalse positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 0 (63 out of 189 samples)\nFalse negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 1 (51 out of 190 samples)\n\nBy having these four categories known would then lead us to the next section about classification report, which showed all the precision, recall, f1-score and support metrics to evaluate the performance of this classifier.\n\n\n\nClassification report\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_mp))\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.73      0.71      0.72       202\n           1       0.68      0.69      0.69       177\n\n    accuracy                           0.70       379\n   macro avg       0.70      0.70      0.70       379\nweighted avg       0.70      0.70      0.70       379\n\n\n\nPrecision was a measure of the accuracy of a predicted outcome, where a class label had been predicted by the classifier. So in this case, we could see that for class label 1, the precision was 0.67, which corresponded to the true positive result of 126 out of 189 samples (= 0.666). It was defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Positive)}\n\\]\nRecall, also known as sensitivity (especially widely used in biostatistics and medical diagnostic fields), was a measure of the strength of the classifier to predict a positive outcome. In simple words, it measured the true positive rate. In this example, there was a total of 126 out of 177 samples (which = 0.712, for True Max_Phase = 1 row) that had a true positive outcome of having a max phase of 1. It was defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Negative)}\n\\]\nThe precision and recall metrics could also be calculated for class label = 0, which were shown for the row 0 in the classification report.\nf1-score, or also known as balanced F-score or F-measure, denoted the harmonic average of both precision and recall metrics. This metric would also give another indication about whether this model performed well on outcome predictions. It normally ranged from 0 (worst precision and recall) to 1 (perfect precision and recall). For this particular classifier, f1-score was at 0.69 (for class label = 1), which was definitely not at its worst, but also could be further improved. It was defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{F1-score} = \\frac{2 \\times (Precision \\times Recall)}{(Precision + Recall)}\n\\]\nSupport, which some readers might have already worked out how the numbers were derived, was the total number of true samples in each class label (reading row-wise from the confusion matrix). The main purpose of showing this metric was to help clarifying whether the model or classifier had a reasonably balanced dataset for each class or otherwise.\n\n\n\nLog loss\nLog loss could be used as another gauge to show how good the classifier was at making the outcome predictions. The further the predicted probability was from the true value, the larger the log loss, which was also ranged from 0 to 1. Ideally, the smaller the log loss the better the model would be. Here, we had a log loss of 0.607 for this particular model.\n\n# Log loss\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nlog_loss(y_test, y_mp_proba)\n\n0.6171675830247453\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions and conclusion\nSo here I’ve completed a very basic LR classifier model for ChEMBL compound dataset. By no means was this a perfect ML model as I haven’t actually changed the default settings of scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression() classifier, with examples such as adjusting C, a regularization parameter which was set at ‘1.0’ by default, and also solvers, which could take in different algorithms for use in optimisation problems and normally set as ‘lbfgs’ by default.\nSo with this default LR model, the evaluation metrics demonstrated a LR classifer of moderate quality to predict the approval outcomes on ChEMBL small molecules, with a lot of rooms for improvements. Therefore, I could not yet confirm fully that the physicochemical parameters chosen would be the best ones to predict the approval outcomes for any small molecules. However, I might be okay to say that these molecular parameters were on the right track to help with making this prediction.\nTo further improve this model, I could possibly trial changing the C value and use different solvers to see if better outcomes could be achieved, or even add more molecular parameters in the model to test. I could have also trialled adding more class labels, e.g. making it between max phase 1, 2 and 4, or a mix-and-match between each max phase category. Other things to consider would be to use other types of ML methods such as naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbours or decision trees and so on. To tackle the problem thoroughly, I would most likely need to do an ensemble of different ML models to find out which model would be the most optimal to answer our target question.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nI’ve experienced the fun of ML after completing this project. The idea was to build on what I knew gradually and enjoy what ML could do when making critical decisions. From what I’ve learnt about ML so far (and definitely more to learn) was that the quality of data was vital for making meaningful interpretations of the results.\nHowever, jumping back to present time, I’ll need to work on my second project first, which is about using Rust interactively via Jupyter notebook. At the moment, I’m not sure how long it will take or how the content will play out. I’ll certainly do as much as I can since Rust is very new to me. If I get very stuck, I’d most likely continue on this ML series. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nReferences\nI’ve listed below most of the references used throughout this project.

The key to understand pKi here was to treat pKi similarly to how we normally understand pH for our acids and bases. The formula to convert Ki to pKi for nanomolar (nM) units was:\n\\[\n\\text{pKi} = 9 - log _{10}(Ki)\n\\]\nSet up a small function to do the conversion.\n\ndef calc_pKi(Ki):\n    pKi_value = 9 - math.log10(Ki)\n    return pKi_value\n\nApplying the calc_pKi function to convert all rows of the compound dataset for the “Ki” column.\n\n# Create a new column for pKi\n# Apply calc_pKi function to data in Ki column\ndtree_df[\"pKi\"] = dtree_df.apply(lambda x: calc_pKi(x.Ki), axis = 1)\n\nThe dataframe would now look like this, with a new pKi column (scroll to the very right to see it).\n\ndtree_df.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\nKi\nunits\ndata_validity_comment\nmax_phase\nsmiles\npKi\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL11805\n0.104\nnM\nPotential transcription error\nNaN\nCOc1ccccc1CN(C)CCCCCC(=O)N(C)CCCCCCCCN(C)C(=O)...\n9.982967\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL60745\n1.630\nnM\nNaN\nNaN\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n8.787812\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL208599\n0.026\nnM\nNaN\nNaN\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n10.585027\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan other data preprocessing steps\nFor a decision tree model, a few more molecular descriptors were most likely needed rather than only Ki or pKi and SMILES, since I’ve now arrived at the step of planning other preprocessing steps. One way to do this could be through computations based on canonical SMILES of compounds by using RDKit, which would give the RDKit 2D descriptors. In this single tree model, I decided to stick with only RDKit 2D descriptors for now, before adding on fingerprints (as a side note: I have very lightly touched on generating fingerprints in this earlier post - “Molecular similarities in selected COVID-19 antivirals” in the subsection on “Fingerprint generator”).\nAt this stage, a compound sanitisation step should also be applied to the compound column before starting any calculations to rule out compounds with questionable chemical validities. RDKit or Datamol (a Python wrapper library built based on RDKit) was also capable of doing this.\nI’ve added a quick step here to convert the data types of “smiles” and “data_validity_comment” columns to string (in case of running into problems later).\n\ndtree_df = dtree_df.astype({\"smiles\": \"string\", \"data_validity_comment\": \"string\"})\ndtree_df.dtypes\n\nmolecule_chembl_id        object\nKi                       float64\nunits                     object\ndata_validity_comment     string\nmax_phase                float64\nsmiles                    string\npKi                      float64\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck data validity\nAlso, before jumping straight to compound sanitisation, I needed to check the “data_validity_comment” column.\n\ndtree_df[\"data_validity_comment\"].unique()\n\n&lt;StringArray&gt;\n['Potential transcription error', &lt;NA&gt;, 'Outside typical range']\nLength: 3, dtype: string\n\n\nThere were 3 different types of data validity comments here, which were “Potential transcription error”, “NaN” and “Outside typical range”.

Each step of fix_mol(), sanitize_mol() and standardize_mol() was explained in this tutorial. I think the key was to select preprocessing options required to fit the purpose of the ML models, and the more experiences in doing this, the more likely it will help with the preprocessing step.\n\n# _preprocess function to sanitise compounds - adapted from datamol.io\n\nsmiles_column = \"smiles\"\n\ndm.disable_rdkit_log()\n\ndef _preprocess(row):\n    # Convert each compound to a RDKit molecule in the smiles column\n    mol = dm.to_mol(row[smiles_column], ordered=True)\n    # Fix common errors in the molecules\n    mol = dm.fix_mol(mol)\n    # Sanitise the molecules \n    mol = dm.sanitize_mol(mol, sanifix=True, charge_neutral=False)\n    # Standardise the molecules\n    mol = dm.standardize_mol(\n        mol,\n        # Switch on to disconnect metal ions\n        disconnect_metals=True,\n        normalize=True,\n        reionize=True,\n        # Switch on \"uncharge\" to neutralise charges\n        uncharge=True,\n        # Taking care of stereochemistries of compounds\n        stereo=True,\n    )\n\n    # Added a new column below for RDKit molecules\n    row[\"rdkit_mol\"] = dm.to_mol(mol)\n    row[\"standard_smiles\"] = dm.standardize_smiles(dm.to_smiles(mol))\n    row[\"selfies\"] = dm.to_selfies(mol)\n    row[\"inchi\"] = dm.to_inchi(mol)\n    row[\"inchikey\"] = dm.to_inchikey(mol)\n    return row\n\nThen the compound sanitisation function was applied to the dtree_df.\n\ndtree_san_df = dtree_df.apply(_preprocess, axis = 1)\ndtree_san_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\nKi\nunits\ndata_validity_comment\nmax_phase\nsmiles\npKi\nrdkit_mol\nstandard_smiles\nselfies\ninchi\ninchikey\n\n\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL60745\n1.630\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n8.787812\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120080f90&gt;\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n[C][C][N+1][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][=...\nInChI=1S/C10H15NO.BrH/c1-4-11(2,3)9-6-5-7-10(1...\nCAEPIUXAUPYIIJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL208599\n0.026\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n10.585027\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081cb0&gt;\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n[C][C][C][=C][C][C][C][=N][C][=C][C][Branch1][...\nInChI=1S/C18H19ClN2/c1-2-10-5-11-7-12(6-10)17-...\nQTPHSDHUHXUYFE-KIYNQFGBSA-N\n\n\n3\nCHEMBL95\n151.000\nnM\nnone\n4.0\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n6.821023\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081700&gt;\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n[N][C][=C][C][=Branch1][N][=N][C][=C][C][=C][C...\nInChI=1S/C13H14N2/c14-13-9-5-1-3-7-11(9)15-12-...\nYLJREFDVOIBQDA-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n4\nCHEMBL173309\n12.200\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCCN(CCCCCC(=O)N(C)CCCCCCCCN(C)C(=O)CCCCCN(CC)C...\n7.913640\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x1200af450&gt;\nCCN(CCCCCC(=O)N(C)CCCCCCCCN(C)C(=O)CCCCCN(CC)C...\n[C][C][N][Branch2][Branch1][Ring1][C][C][C][C]...\nInChI=1S/C42H70N4O4/c1-7-45(35-37-25-17-19-27-...\nVJXLWYGKZGTXAF-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n5\nCHEMBL1128\n200.000\nnM\nnone\n4.0\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Cl-]\n6.698970\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x1200af3e0&gt;\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Cl-]\n[C][C][N+1][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][=...\nInChI=1S/C10H15NO.ClH/c1-4-11(2,3)9-6-5-7-10(1...\nBXKDSDJJOVIHMX-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the dataset required for sanitisation is large, Datamol has suggested using their example code to add parallelisation as shown below.\n```{python}\n# Code adapted from: https://docs.datamol.io/stable/tutorials/Preprocessing.html#references\ndata_clean = dm.parallelized(\n    _preprocess, \n    data.iterrows(), \n    arg_type=\"args\", \n    progress=True, \n    total=len(data)\n    )\ndata_clean = pd.DataFrame(data_clean)\n```\n\ndtree_san_df.shape\n\n(481, 12)\n\n\nIn this case, I tried using the preprocessing function without adding parallelisation, the whole process wasn’t very long (since I had a small dataset), and was done within a minute or so.\nAlso, as a sanity check on the sanitised compounds in dtree_san_df, I just wanted to see if I could display all compounds in this dataframe as 2D images. I also had a look through each page just to see if there were any odd bonds or anything strange in general.\n\n# Create a list to store all cpds in dtree_san_df\nmol_list = dtree_san_df[\"rdkit_mol\"]\n# Convert to list\nmol_list = list(mol_list)\n# Check data type\ntype(mol_list)\n# Show 2D compound structures in grids\nmols2grid.display(mol_list)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect outliers\nPlotting a histogram to see the distribution of pKi values first.\n\ndtree_san_df.hist(column = \"pKi\")\n\narray([[&lt;AxesSubplot: title={'center': 'pKi'}&gt;]], dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI read a bit about Dixon’s Q test and realised that there were a few required assumptions prior to using this test, and the current dataset used here (dtree_san_df) might not fit the requirements, which were:\n\nnormally distributed data\na small sample size e.g. between 3 and 10, which was originally stated in this paper (Dean and Dixon 1951).\n\nI’ve also decided that rather than showing Python code for Dixon’s Q test myself, I would attach a few examples from others instead, for example, Q test from Plotly and Dixon’s Q test for outlier identification – a questionable practice, since this dataset here wasn’t quite normally distributed as shown from the histogram above.\n\ndtree_san_df.boxplot(column = \"pKi\")\n\n# the boxplot version below shows a blank background\n# rather than above version with horizontal grid lines\n#dtree_san_df.plot.box(column = \"pKi\")\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also used Pandas’ built-in boxplot in addition to the histogram to show the possible outliers within the pKi values. Clearly, the outliers for pKi values appeared to be above 10. I also didn’t remove these outliers completely due to the dataset itself wasn’t quite in a Gaussian distribution (they might not be true outliers).\n\n\n\nCalculate RDKit 2D molecular descriptors\nI’ve explored a few different ways to compute molecular descriptors, essentially RDKit was used as the main library to do this (there might be other options via other programming languages, but I was only exploring RDKit-based methods via Python for now). A blog post I’ve come across on calculating RDKit 2D molecular descriptors has explained it well, it gave details about how to bundle the functions together in a class (the idea of building a small library yourself to be used in projects was quite handy). I’ve also read RDKit’s documentations and also the ones from Datamol. So rather than re-inventing the wheels of all the RDKit code, I’ve opted to use only a small chunk of RDKit code as a demonstration, then followed by Datamol’s version to compute the 2D descriptors, since there were already a few really well-explained blog posts about this. One of the examples was this useful descriptor calculation tutorial by Greg Landrum.\n\n\nRDKit code\nWith the lastest format of the dtree_san_df, it already included a RDKit molecule column (named “rdkit_mol”), so this meant I could go ahead with the calculations. So here I used RDKit’s Descriptors.CalcMolDescriptors() to calculate the 2D descriptors - note: there might be more code variations depending on needs, this was just a small example.\n\n# Run descriptor calculations on mol_list (created earlier)\n# and save as a new list\nmol_rdkit_ls = [Descriptors.CalcMolDescriptors(mol) for mol in mol_list]\n\n# Convert the list into a dataframe\ndf_rdkit_2d = pd.DataFrame(mol_rdkit_ls)\nprint(df_rdkit_2d.shape)\ndf_rdkit_2d.head(3)\n\n(481, 209)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaxAbsEStateIndex\nMaxEStateIndex\nMinAbsEStateIndex\nMinEStateIndex\nqed\nMolWt\nHeavyAtomMolWt\nExactMolWt\nNumValenceElectrons\nNumRadicalElectrons\n...\nfr_sulfide\nfr_sulfonamd\nfr_sulfone\nfr_term_acetylene\nfr_tetrazole\nfr_thiazole\nfr_thiocyan\nfr_thiophene\nfr_unbrch_alkane\nfr_urea\n\n\n\n\n0\n9.261910\n9.261910\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.662462\n246.148\n230.020\n245.041526\n74\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n6.509708\n6.509708\n0.547480\n0.547480\n0.763869\n298.817\n279.665\n298.123676\n108\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n6.199769\n6.199769\n0.953981\n0.953981\n0.706488\n198.269\n184.157\n198.115698\n76\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n3 rows × 209 columns\n\n\n\nIn total, it generated 209 descriptors.\n\n\n\nDatamol code\nThen I tested Datamol’s code on this as shown below.\n\n# Datamol's batch descriptor code for a list of compounds\ndtree_san_df_dm = dm.descriptors.batch_compute_many_descriptors(mol_list)\nprint(dtree_san_df_dm.shape)\ndtree_san_df_dm.head(3)\n\n(481, 22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\nn_rotatable_bonds\nn_radical_electrons\ntpsa\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n2\n0\n20.23\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n1\n0\n38.91\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n0\n0\n38.91\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n3 rows × 22 columns\n\n\n\nThere were a total of 22 molecular descriptors generated, which seemed more like what I might use for the decision tree model. The limitation with this batch descriptor code was that the molecular features were pre-selected, so if other types were needed, it would be the best to go for RDKit code or look into other Datamol descriptor code that allow users to specify features. The types of descriptors were shown below.\n\ndtree_san_df_dm.columns\n\nIndex(['mw', 'fsp3', 'n_lipinski_hba', 'n_lipinski_hbd', 'n_rings',\n       'n_hetero_atoms', 'n_heavy_atoms', 'n_rotatable_bonds',\n       'n_radical_electrons', 'tpsa', 'qed', 'clogp', 'sas',\n       'n_aliphatic_carbocycles', 'n_aliphatic_heterocyles',\n       'n_aliphatic_rings', 'n_aromatic_carbocycles', 'n_aromatic_heterocyles',\n       'n_aromatic_rings', 'n_saturated_carbocycles',\n       'n_saturated_heterocyles', 'n_saturated_rings'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombine dataframes\nThe trickier part for data preprocessing was actually trying to merge, join or concatenate dataframes of the preprocessed dataframe (dtree_san_df) and the dataframe from Datamol’s descriptor code (dtree_san_df_dm).\nInitially, I tried using all of Pandas’ code of merge/join/concat() dataframes. They all failed to create the correct final combined dataframe with too many rows generated, with one run actually created more than 500 rows (maximum should be 481 rows). One of the possible reasons for this could be that some of the descriptors had zeros generated as results for some of the compounds, and when combining dataframes using Pandas code like the ones mentioned here, they might cause unexpected results (as suggested by Pandas, these code were not exactly equivalent to SQL joins). So I looked into different ways, and while there were no other common columns for both dataframes, the index column seemed to be the only one that correlated both.\nI also found out after going back to the previous steps that when I applied the compound preprocessing function from Datamol, the index of the resultant dataframe was changed to start from 1 (rather than zero). Because of this, I tried re-setting the index of dtree_san_df first, then dropped the index column, followed by re-setting the index again to ensure it started at zero, which has worked. So now the dtree_san_df would have exactly the same index as the one for dtree_san_df_dm.\n\n# 1st index re-set\ndtree_san_df = dtree_san_df.reset_index()\n# Drop the index column\ndtree_san_df = dtree_san_df.drop([\"index\"], axis = 1)\ndtree_san_df.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\nKi\nunits\ndata_validity_comment\nmax_phase\nsmiles\npKi\nrdkit_mol\nstandard_smiles\nselfies\ninchi\ninchikey\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n1.630\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n8.787812\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120080f90&gt;\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n[C][C][N+1][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][=...\nInChI=1S/C10H15NO.BrH/c1-4-11(2,3)9-6-5-7-10(1...\nCAEPIUXAUPYIIJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n0.026\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n10.585027\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081cb0&gt;\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n[C][C][C][=C][C][C][C][=N][C][=C][C][Branch1][...\nInChI=1S/C18H19ClN2/c1-2-10-5-11-7-12(6-10)17-...\nQTPHSDHUHXUYFE-KIYNQFGBSA-N\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL95\n151.000\nnM\nnone\n4.0\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n6.821023\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081700&gt;\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n[N][C][=C][C][=Branch1][N][=N][C][=C][C][=C][C...\nInChI=1S/C13H14N2/c14-13-9-5-1-3-7-11(9)15-12-...\nYLJREFDVOIBQDA-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2nd index re-set\ndtree_san_df = dtree_san_df.reset_index()\nprint(dtree_san_df.shape)\ndtree_san_df.head(3)\n\n(481, 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\nmolecule_chembl_id\nKi\nunits\ndata_validity_comment\nmax_phase\nsmiles\npKi\nrdkit_mol\nstandard_smiles\nselfies\ninchi\ninchikey\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n1.630\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n8.787812\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120080f90&gt;\nCC[N+](C)(C)c1cccc(O)c1.[Br-]\n[C][C][N+1][Branch1][C][C][Branch1][C][C][C][=...\nInChI=1S/C10H15NO.BrH/c1-4-11(2,3)9-6-5-7-10(1...\nCAEPIUXAUPYIIJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n1\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n0.026\nnM\nnone\nNaN\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n10.585027\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081cb0&gt;\nCCC1=CC2Cc3nc4cc(Cl)ccc4c(N)c3[C@@H](C1)C2\n[C][C][C][=C][C][C][C][=N][C][=C][C][Branch1][...\nInChI=1S/C18H19ClN2/c1-2-10-5-11-7-12(6-10)17-...\nQTPHSDHUHXUYFE-KIYNQFGBSA-N\n\n\n2\n2\nCHEMBL95\n151.000\nnM\nnone\n4.0\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n6.821023\n&lt;rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol object at 0x120081700&gt;\nNc1c2c(nc3ccccc13)CCCC2\n[N][C][=C][C][=Branch1][N][=N][C][=C][C][=C][C...\nInChI=1S/C13H14N2/c14-13-9-5-1-3-7-11(9)15-12-...\nYLJREFDVOIBQDA-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso re-setting the index of the dtree_san_df_dm.\n\ndtree_san_df_dm = dtree_san_df_dm.reset_index()\nprint(dtree_san_df_dm.shape)\ndtree_san_df_dm.head(3)\n\n(481, 23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\nn_rotatable_bonds\nn_radical_electrons\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n2\n0\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n1\n0\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n2\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n0\n0\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n3 rows × 23 columns\n\n\n\nMerged both dataframes of dtree_san_df and dtree_san_df_dm based on their indices.\n\n# merge dtree_san_df & dtree_san_df_dm\ndtree_f_df = pd.merge(\n    dtree_san_df[[\"index\", \"molecule_chembl_id\", \"pKi\", \"max_phase\"]],\n    dtree_san_df_dm,\n    left_index=True,\n    right_index=True\n)\n\nChecking final dataframe to make sure there were 481 rows (also that index_x and index_y were identical) and also there was an increased number of columns (columns combined from both dataframes).

The subsections presented in this post bascially reflected my thought processes, as there were some back-and-forths. The whole data preprocessing step was probably still not thorough enough, but I’ve tried to cover as much as I could (hopefully I didn’t go overboard with it…). Also, it might still not be ideal to use Ki values this freely as mentioned in post 1 (noises in data issues).\nIt was mentioned in scikit-learn that for decision tree models, because of its non-parametric nature, there were not a lot of data cleaning required. However, I think that might be domain-specific, since for the purpose of drug discovery, if this step wasn’t done properly, whatever result that came out of the ML model most likely would not work and also would not reflect real-life scenarios. I was also planning on extending this series to add more trees to the model, that is, from one tree (decision tree), to multiple trees (random forests), and then hopefully move on to boosted trees (XGBoost and LightGBM). Therefore, I’d better do this data cleaning step well first to save some time later (if using the same set of data).\nNext post will be about model building using scikit-learn and also a small part on estimating experimental errors on the dataset - this is going to be in post 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nDean, R.

The main statistical principles and concepts being referred to here are mostly from this reference textbook (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020), and a lot of native built-in functions from scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011) are used to generate the results.\n\nAccuracy scores\nThe easiest one to understand will be accuracy score, which can be calculated using predicted y outcome and actual or true y outcome in scikit-learn as shown below.\n\n## Read in data & split into training & testing sets\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"df_ml.csv\")\nX = df[\"#RO5 Violations\", \"Polar Surface Area\", \"HBA\", \"HBD\", \"QED Weighted\", \"CX LogP\", \"CX LogD\", \"Heavy Atoms\"]\ny = df[\"Max_Phase\"]\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 50)\nLR.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_mp = LR.predict(X_test)\naccuracy_score(y_mp, y_test)\n\n## getting a warning message after accuracy score generated earlier \n# \"UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but LogisticRegression was fitted with feature names\" \n# - resolved, missed the fitting step first (my bad) before predict()\n\n0.689594356261023\n\n\nThe accuracy score is 0.69 (after rounding up) which means that there are around 70% of the cases or compounds classified correctly by using the LR classifier. This score is also the same as the one shown from the previous post using score() instead of accuracy_score().\nAccuracy score gives an idea about how close the predicted samples are to the true values. One caveat to note is that for imbalanced dataset, accuracy score might not be very informative and other evaluation metrics will be needed as well.\n\n\n\nConfusion matrix\nA confusion matrix is built below based on the model in order to visualise the counts of correct and incorrect predictions. Previous code used to plot confusion matrix is shown below:\n\n\nCode\n## Function to print and plot confusion matrix\n## The function code below was adapted from the IBM data science course I've taken previously\n\n# # to create iterators for efficient looping\n# import itertools\n# import numpy as np\n\n# def plot_confusion_matrix(# Sets a cm object (cm = confusion matrix)\n#                           cm, \n#                           # Sets classes of '1s' (Successes) & '0s' (Non-successes) for the cm\n#                           classes,\n#                           # If setting normalize = true, reports in ratios instead of counts\n#                           normalize,\n#                           title = 'Confusion matrix',\n#                           # Choose colour of the cm (using colourmap recognised by matplotlib)\n#                           cmap = plt.cm.Reds):\n    \n    # if normalize:\n    #     cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis = 1)[:, np.newaxis]\n    #     print(\"Normalized confusion matrix\")\n    # else:\n    #     print('Confusion matrix, without normalization')\n\n    # print(cm)\n\n    # # Plot the confusion matrix \n    # plt.imshow(cm, interpolation = 'nearest', cmap = cmap)\n    # plt.title(title)\n    # plt.colorbar()\n    # tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n    # plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation = 45)\n    # plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)\n\n    # # Floats to be round up to two decimal places if using normalize = True\n    # # or else use integers\n    # fmt = '.2f' if normalize else 'd'\n    # # Sets threshold of 0.5\n    # thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    # # Iterate through the results and differentiate between two text colours \n    # # by using the threshold as a cut-off\n    # for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n    #     plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt),\n    #              horizontalalignment = \"center\",\n    #              color = \"white\" if cm[i, j] &gt; thresh else \"black\")\n\n    # plt.tight_layout()\n    # plt.ylabel('True label')\n    # plt.xlabel('Predicted label')\n\n# # Compute confusion matrix\n# matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_mp, labels = [0,1])\n# np.set_printoptions(precision = 2)\n\n# # Plot confusion matrix without normalisation\n# plt.figure()\n# plot_confusion_matrix(matrix, \n#                       # Define classes of outcomes\n#                       classes = ['Max_Phase = 0','Max_Phase = 1'], \n#                       # Set normalize = True if wanting ratios instead\n#                       normalize = False, \n#                       title = \"Confusion matrix without normalisation\"\n#                      )\n\n\nThere is actually an alternative and probably a better way (that uses less code) to plot confusion matrix using scikit-learn’s code as shown here:\n\nConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(LR, X_test, y_test)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common rule of thumb for confusion matrix is that all predicted outcomes are columns and all the true outcomes are rows. However, there might be exceptions where this would be the other way round.\nFour different categories can be seen in the confusion matrix:\n\nTrue positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 1 (391) - interested in this\nTrue negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 0 (391)\nFalse positive - Predicted Max_Phase = 1 & True Max_Phase = 0 (167)\nFalse negative - Predicted Max_Phase = 0 & True Max_Phase = 1 (185)\n\n\n\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve\nMy old post about random forest classifier has already explained what an area under the ROC curve is (I’m just going to quote myself…):\n\nArea under the ROC curve: reference - the area under a curve plot between sensitivity or recall (percent of all 1s classified correctly by a classifier or true positive rate) and specificity (percent of all 0s classified correctly by a classifier, or equivalent to 1 - false positive rate or true negative rate) (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020). It is useful for evaluating the performance of a classification model via comparing the true positive rate and false positive rate which are influenced by shifting the decision threshold. Area under the ROC is usually represented as a number ranging from 0 to 1 (1 being a perfect classifier, 0.5 or below meaning a poor, ineffective classifier)\n\nIn this case, we can also apply ROC curve to the LR model and its predicted outcomes.\n\n# get the predicted probabilities of outcome = 1 (approved drugs)\ny_mp_probs = LR.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\nRocCurveDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, y_mp_probs, plot_chance_level = True)\n\n&lt;sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay at 0x12cfd02d0&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification report\n\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_mp))\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.68      0.70      0.69       558\n           1       0.70      0.68      0.69       576\n\n    accuracy                           0.69      1134\n   macro avg       0.69      0.69      0.69      1134\nweighted avg       0.69      0.69      0.69      1134\n\n\n\nPrecision is a measure of the accuracy of a predicted outcome, where a class label has been predicted by the classifier. In this case, we can see that for class label 1, the precision is 0.70, which corresponds to the true positive result of 391 out of 558 samples (= 0.70, for true predicted Max_Phase = 1 column). It is defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Positive)}\n\\]\nRecall, also known as sensitivity (especially widely used in biostatistics and medical diagnostic fields), is a measure of the strength of the classifier to predict a positive outcome. In simple words, it measures the true positive rate. In this example, there is a total of 391 out of 576 samples (which = 0.68, for true Max_Phase = 1 row). It is defined by:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive}{(\\Sigma\\ True\\ Positive + \\Sigma\\ False\\ Negative)}\n\\]\nThe precision and recall metrics are also calculated and shown for row 0 in the classification report.\nf1-score, or also known as balanced F-score or F-measure, denoted the harmonic average of both precision and recall metrics. This metric will also give another indication about whether this model performed well on outcome predictions. Its range is normally from 0 (worst precision and recall) to 1 (perfect precision and recall). For this particular classifier, f1-score was at 0.69 (for class label = 1). It is defined as:\n\\[\n\\text{F1-score} = \\frac{2 \\times (Precision \\times Recall)}{(Precision + Recall)}\n\\]\nSupport is the total number of true samples in each class label (reading row-wise from the confusion matrix). The main purpose of showing this metric is to help clarifying whether the model has had a reasonably balanced dataset for each class (and also helped to check the precision and recall values if needed).\n\n\n\nLog loss\nLog loss can be used as another metric to show how good the classifier is at making the predictions. The further apart the predicted probability is from the true value, the larger the log loss, which is also ranging from 0 to 1. Ideally, the smaller the log loss the better the model will be. Here, we have a log loss of 0.61 (after rounding up) for this particular model.\n\nlog_loss(y_test, y_mp_probs)\n\n0.6097696128595831\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts\nSo here I’ve completed a very basic LR classifier model for ChEMBL small molecules dataset. This is certainly not the most optimal machine learning model as I’ve only wanted to show how a baseline LR model can be built. This post update has added a molecular features versus coefficients plot (in the previous post) which shows the different weightings of the features used to train the dataset, ideally I should include more to provide a better overview of how the physicochemical properties will influence the prediction outcomes, but potentially this plot sort of answers the main goal of the post - which molecular properties might influence max phase outcomes. This last post here is really to show all the different evaluation metrics for the LR model, and I’ve added a ROC curve this time.\nTo further improve this model, I could possibly try hyperparameter tuning although I’ve come across comments from others in the past that it might not improve LR model that much once it’s done. Originally I do have two other posts following on from the first one (which is currently splitted into four smaller posts), and one of them is about hyperparameter tuning. My possible plan at the moment is to maybe update these other two posts further down the line and I may decide to condense or remove them if it’s not really going to make much difference or impact, I’ll see…\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nHuge thanks to our online open-source communities, libraries, and also all the references used in this series of posts.\n\n\n\nOnline references\nI’ve listed below all the online references used throughout this project.

This also applies if using fit_transform() or transform() when not using pipeline - see scikit-learn reference on “transform”.\n\n\n\nPrepare training and testing sets\nThen the data will be further splitted into separate training and testing sets.\n\n## Random number generator\n#rng = np.random.RandomState(0) - note: this may produce different result each time\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 50)\nprint('Training set:', X_train.shape, y_train.shape)\nprint('Testing set:', X_test.shape, y_test.shape)\n\nTraining set: (4536, 8) (4536,)\nTesting set: (1134, 8) (1134,)\n\n\n\n\n\nPipeline method\nSome benefits of using pipeline (scikit-learn reference):\n\nchaining preprocessing step with different transformers and estimators in one go where we only have to call fit and predict once on our data\navoiding data leakage from the testing set into the training set by making sure the same set of samples is used to train the transformers and predictors\navoiding missing out on the transform step (note: calling fit() on pipeline is equivalent to calling fit() on each estimator and transform() input data before the next step, plus StandardScaler() is going to be used in the pipeline as well - repeating myself here but this is just a gentle reminder…)\n\nThe example below uses Pipeline() to construct a pipeline that takes in a standard scaler to scale data and also a LR estimator, along with some parameters.\n\n## Pipeline:\n\n# Ensure prediction output can be read in polars df\nset_config(transform_output=\"polars\")\n\n# multi_class defaults to 'auto' which selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear'\n# multi_class is deprecated in version 1.5 and will be removed in 1.7 \n# this post uses sklearn version 1.5.0\nparams_lr = {\n  # solver for small dataset\n  \"solver\": \"liblinear\",\n  \"random_state\": 50\n}\n\nLR = Pipeline(steps=[\n  # Preprocess/scale the dataset (transformer)\n  (\"StandardScaler\", StandardScaler()), # can add set_output() if preferred\n  # e.g. StandardScaler().set_output(transform=\"polars\")\n  # Create an instance of LR classifier (estimator)\n  (\"LogR\", LogisticRegression(**params_lr))\n  ])\n\n# can add set_output() if preferred e.g. LR.set_output(transform=\"polars\")\nLR.fit(X_train, y_train)\npred = LR.predict(X_test)\nLR.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.689594356261023\n\n\nDuring the pipeline building, I’ve figured out how to integrate set_output() in Polars, and noted that the best use case is to show the feature_names_in_ along with coef_ (scikit-learn reference). The first issue is that the feature names are being generated as “[x0, x1, x2…]”, which is not useful. One of the possible reasons could be because all the molecular features are not in strings (as they’re either i64 or f64), so the feature names are not shown - I’m actually unsure about this but this is just my guess.\nOne of the other ways I’ve tried is to use ColumnTransformer() within the pipeline (scikit-learn reference - code example folded below) but unfortunately it hasn’t worked as well as expected.\n\n\nCode\n# from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n# num_cols = [\"#RO5 Violations\", \"Polar Surface Area\", \"HBA\", \"HBD\", \"QED Weighted\", \"CX LogP\", \"CX LogD\", \"Heavy Atoms\"]\n# ct = ColumnTransformer(\n#     (\"numerical\", num_cols),\n#     verbose_feature_names_out=False,\n#   )\n# ct.set_output(transform=\"polars\")\n\n\nThe pipeline above is the final version that works to show molecular feature names with their corresponding coefficients in a polars dataframe output. There are 3 options to add either set_config(transform_output=\"polars\") or set_output(transform_output=\"polars\") with the pipeline code - only really needing one line (and not all 3 - it’ll still work but probably unnecessary to add extra code). I’ve marked all 3 options in the pipeline code above.\n\n\n\nMolecular features and coefficients\nNext, I’m calling out the LR model used above in the pipeline as we want to get the feature names used for training and predicting along with their corresponding coefficients, and generate a bar chart to show their relationship (reference on plotting directly in Polars using Altair).\n\nlog_reg = LR[-1]\nlog_reg\n\nLogisticRegression(random_state=50, solver='liblinear')In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

I’ve sorted the order of coefficients from highest to lowest in the chart.\nAnother way to get features names is from the pipeline as well but requires a step saving dataframe column names separately as an NumPy array first (scikit-learn reference). The previous way seems to save a bit more time on coding as there’s no need to do this, and also you can retrieve the coefficients of the features at the same time.\n\n\nCode\n## note: df.columns = column names of physicochemical properties\n# feat_names = pl.Series(\"feat_names\", df.columns[1:])\n# LR[:-1].get_feature_names_out(feat_names)\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicted probabilities\nOne way to get predicted probabilities of the samples in each outcome class (either 0 - not approved or 1 - approved) is via predict_proba() in scikit-learn.\n\ny_mp_pre_proba = LR.predict_proba(X_test)\nprint(y_mp_pre_proba)\n\n[[0.45825999 0.54174001]\n [0.15229678 0.84770322]\n [0.38040658 0.61959342]\n ...\n [0.29652    0.70348   ]\n [0.83812298 0.16187702]\n [0.45729476 0.54270524]]\n\n\nThen we can convert the predicted probabilities into a polars dataframe, along with a statistics summary.\n\npl.DataFrame(y_mp_pre_proba).describe()\n\n\nshape: (9, 3)\n\n\n\nstatistic\ncolumn_0\ncolumn_1\n\n\nstr\nf64\nf64\n\n\n\n\n\"count\"\n1134.0\n1134.0\n\n\n\"null_count\"\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n\"mean\"\n0.486442\n0.513558\n\n\n\"std\"\n0.199652\n0.199652\n\n\n\"min\"\n0.00459\n0.044198\n\n\n\"25%\"\n0.341463\n0.360326\n\n\n\"50%\"\n0.506803\n0.493416\n\n\n\"75%\"\n0.639674\n0.658537\n\n\n\"max\"\n0.955802\n0.99541\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickle LR pipeline\nThis last part is really for saving the LR pipeline for the next post on evaluating the LR model. I’ve talked a bit more about the security aspect of pickling files in this old post in case anyone’s interested.\n\n# Pickle to save (serialise) the model in working directory (specify path if needed)\npickle.dump(LR, open(\"LR.pkl\", \"wb\")) # \"wb\" - write binary\n# Unpickle (de-serialise) the model\nLR2 = pickle.load(open(\"LR.pkl\", \"rb\")) # \"rb\" - read binary\n# Use the unpickled model object to make prediction\npred2 = LR2.predict(X_test)\n## Check unpickled model and original model are the same via Python's assertion method\n#assert np.sum(np.abs(pred2 - pred)) == 0\n## or alternatively use numpy's allclose()\nprint(np.allclose(pred, pred2)) # note: pred = LR.predict(X_test) from original LR pipeline\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

So, a little about what I’m working on lately:\n\n\n\nPhoto by RetroSupply on Unsplash\n\n\n\nI’ve started working on an extension project to the rare disease work (recent Python project) by delving further into the natural history of rare diseases by using Orphanet’s data source (having fun working with xml files)\nWith the turn of events lately, I’m now also learning R programming language (which is something I was planning to do much later, but… to do this now is also fine as this’ll keep me on the ball) and surprisingly it is quite similar to Python in some ways but not at all as well\nTableau project most likely needs further work apart from what the dashboard is looking like at the moment (might be still a bit bare) but at the moment, my focus is on above two projects in the meantime. I’ll try to squeeze more time to work on this soon\n\nOther than that, I’m grateful that I can still work on things of great interests and the world is somehow still functioning in its best possible ways – onwards and upwards hopefully.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Plotly was used as the main data visualisation library, which was followed by some text cleaning for a particularly busy column in the dataset. This was then completed with a section in the end to generate a small dataframe, preparing for a simple data visualisation in Rust-Evcxr for the final part of this project (part 3).\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by

which could be one of the options to plot data from Polars dataframes in Plotly, was to call the x-axis and y-axis data directly from the dataframe as shown in the code below.\n\n# scatter plot for colours, dosage forms & drug strengths \nfig = px.scatter(x = df_viz[\"Colour\"], \n                 y = df_viz[\"Dosage_form\"], \n                 color = df_viz[\"Colour\"],\n                 hover_name = df_viz[\"Drug_strength\"],\n                 width = 900, \n                 height = 400,\n                 title = \"Oral dosage forms and colours of pills\")\n\n# Update layout of the plot\nfig.update_layout(\n    # Change title font size\n    title = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 15)),\n    # Centre the title\n    title_x = 0.5,\n    # Edit margins\n    margin = dict(\n        l = 20, r = 20, t = 40, b = 3),\n    # Change x-axis\n    xaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Colours\"\n    ),\n    # Change y-axis\n    yaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Dosage forms\"\n    ),\n    # Edit lengend font size\n    legend = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 9)))\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nWhite was the most common colour, especially after zooming in the plot. Capsule was very commonly used as the oral dosage form of choice in this dataset.\n\n\n\nVisualising shapes & colours in pills\n\nfig = px.scatter(x = df_viz[\"Colour\"], \n                 y = df_viz[\"Shape\"], \n                 color = df_viz[\"Colour\"],\n                 hover_name = df_viz[\"Drug_strength\"],\n                 width = 900, \n                 height = 400,\n                 title = \"Shapes and colours of pills\")\n\n# Update layout of the plot\nfig.update_layout(\n    # Change title font size\n    title = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 15)),\n    # Centre the title\n    title_x = 0.5,\n    # Edit margins\n    margin = dict(\n        l = 20, r = 20, t = 40, b = 3),\n    # Change x-axis\n    xaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Colours\"\n    ),\n    # Change y-axis\n    yaxis = dict(\n        tickfont = dict(size = 9), \n        title = \"Shapes\"\n    ),\n    # Edit lengend font size\n    legend = dict(\n        font = dict(\n            size = 9)))\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nCapsule was again the most common oral dosage shape used for pills in the dataset. Common colours included red, brown, blue, purple, pink, orange, green, white and yellow. Combination colours followed these common ones, which had a mixture of a variety of colours used simultaneously, likely to avoid confusions and errors in dispensings or administrations.\n\n\n\nVisualising inactive excipients in pills\nThe messiest part of the data actually lied in the column of “Inactive_excipients”, with numerous different punctuations used inconsistently, such as forward slashes, commas and semi-colons. There were vast quantities of different inactive components used for oral dosage forms. Because of this, I had to spend a bit more time cleaning up the texts in order to find out what were the commonly used inactive ingredients in the end.\n\n# Formulated a separate dataframe with just \"Inactive_excipients\"\ndf_ie = df_new.select([pl.col(\"Inactive_excipients\")])\ndf_ie\n\n\n\nshape: (83925, 1)\n\n\n\n\nInactive_excipients\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS LACT...\n\n\n\n\nnull\n\n\n\n\n\"SORBITOL;ASPAR...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\n\n\"LACTOSE MONOHY...\n\n\n\n\n\"FD&C BLUE NO. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"silicon dioxid...\n\n\n\n\n\"CROSPOVIDONE;M...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;C...\n\n\n\n\n\"COPOVIDONE K25...\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\n\n\"BUTYLATED HYDR...\n\n\n\n\n\"MAGNESIUM CARB...\n\n\n\n\n\"ACESULFAME POT...\n\n\n\n\n\"CROSCARMELLOSE...\n\n\n\n\n\"FD&C BLUE NO. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;H...\n\n\n\n\n\"CARNAUBA WAX;F...\n\n\n\n\n\"CITRIC ACID MO...\n\n\n\n\n\"STARCH, CORN;D...\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText cleaning for inactive excipients column\nTo prepare this column for data visualisations, I used Polars’ string expressions (or more commonly known as regex - regular expressions) to try and tidy up the raw texts. When I did the text cleaning in Jupyter Lab initially, the line of code for .str.strip(” ,“) worked, but when I converted the .ipynb file into a .qmd (Quarto markdown) one, and used the same line, it failed to work due to the extra space in front of the comma. However, I got around the error by splitting it into two separate units as space and comma, and it worked without problem. One possible reason would be due to the reticulate package needed to run Python in RStudio IDE, and how Polars dataframe library was relatively newer than Pandas dataframe library, which meant certain features in Polars might not have been taken on board in the reticulate package (only my guess).\n\n# Clean string texts \n# Convert uppercase letters into lowercase ones in the excipients column\ndf_de = (df_ie.with_column(pl.col(\"Inactive_excipients\").str.to_lowercase(\n    # replace old punctuations (1st position) with new one (2nd position)\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \";\", \", \"\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \" /\", \", \"\n    ).str.replace_all(\n        \"/\", \", \"\n    # Remove extra space & comma by stripping\n    # In Jupyter notebook/lab - can combine space & comma: .str.strip(\" ,\")\n    # For RStudio IDE - separate into two for this to work\n    ).str.strip(\n        \" \"\n    ).str.strip(\n        \",\"\n    # Split the texts by the specified punctuation e.g. comma with space\n    ).str.split(\n        by = \", \"\n    # Create a new column with a new name\n    ).alias(\n        \"Inactive\"\n    )\n# Explode the splitted texts into separate rows within the new column\n).explode(\n    \"Inactive\"\n)\n)\n\ndf_de\n\n\n\nshape: (840029, 2)\n\n\n\n\nInactive_excipients\n\n\nInactive\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"silicon dioxid...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"edetate disodi...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"lactose monohy...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"magnesium stea...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"cellulose\"\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"microcrystalli...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"starch\"\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"corn\"\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"sodium lauryl ...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"fd&c blue no. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"fd&c red no. 4...\n\n\n\n\n\"SILICON DIOXID...\n\n\n\"gelatin\"\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\"shellac\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\"propylene glyc...\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\"ammonia\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Cellulose, mic...\n\n\n\"fd&c blue no. ...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"anhydrous diba...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"ferric oxide r...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"hypromelloses\"\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"polyethylene g...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"magnesium stea...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"titanium dioxi...\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"talc\"\n\n\n\n\n\"ANHYDROUS DIBA...\n\n\n\"ferric oxide y...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Quick look at the dataframe to see before and after text cleaning\nprint(df_de.glimpse())\n\nRows: 840029\nColumns: 2\n$ Inactive_excipients &lt;Utf8&gt;

From what I’ve worked out here, the most frequently used inactive ingredient was magnesium stearate, which was followed by titanium dioxide, and then interestingly “unspecified”, which was exactly how it was documented in the original pillbox dataset at the beginning. I didn’t go further digging into what this “unspecified” inactive excipients might be, as in whether it meant it in a singular or plural forms. So this still remained a mystery at this stage, but if all these oral medications were FDA-approved, we would’ve hoped each and everyone of these pills would be verified in safety, quality and effectiveness before they entered into the market for wide prescriptions.

At the very least, I’ve kind of tried something I’ve planned for, although not looking very elegant yet, with rooms for improvements in the future.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

While working on my very first portfolio blog at WordPress, I’ve also stumbled across R programming language (due to a data analytics work interview where they actually tested me R!). This then opened up a whole new R world with its friendly online community. Since my interests in R grew further and further, I’ve been looking for places where I can use RStudio IDE and/or R to build blogs and gladly I found Quarto which led me to its Quarto blogs.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lia Trevarthen on Unsplash\n\n\nSo here is my very first Quarto blog, deployed using Netlify initially and then I also figured out how to deploy it on GitHub Pages, so now I’ve actually got two extra sites running. The process to deploy on Netlify was quite simple as many people have already mentioned (GitHub Pages were also not too complicated as well once I’ve grasped the deployment workflow). I’m still pondering if I should write something on how I started Quarto blogs, but considering so many talented people have already talked about it, I may not go down this route (consider visiting Bea Milz’s lovely post on “Creating a blog with Quarto in 10 steps” - this was what I followed to get my Quarto blog up and running).\nI will be slowly moving my current posts and portfolio projects from WordPress to Quarto blogs. Who knows, maybe I may end up working on building websites, or doing other things that I’ve never imagined I would do before!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

I’ve also often wondered about drugs for rare diseases and how they’re often for the minorities in the diseased populations. So here is the initial Python and R projects1 about rare disease drugs by using data extracted from FDA’s Orphan Drug Product designation database. I also have to acknowledge “Data Is Plural” website, which has inspired me to look into this dataset.\nUnfortunately this particular dataset I’ve obtained does not contain information on incentives for pharmaceutical companies (from US’s Orphan Drug Act of 1983), which could mean that I might be able to draw some preliminary, basic or raw correlations between incentives and rare disease drug marketing approvals (this might lead to other controversial discussions about this area, which was not my initial aim for this project as I just wanted to explore a dataset on rare disease drugs at the moment).\nThe datatset was for the period from 1983 till present, for approved rare disease drugs only."

    "text": "Essentially, having completed this MPhil project1 was more like a warm-up before participating in a real research project at a grand scale. This was a new project at the time (between 2012 – 2014) as no one in my previous lab group was working on it so it was literally a one-person project but we were collaborating with a distant research group. Unfortunately this project came to an early stop during my PhD stage (when I was working part-time still as a pharmacist to support my own cost of living while receiving a puny amount of scholarship plus working on this project at the time and then one extra project added on during PhD). The main reason that this project did no progress was that our collaborators decided to pull out from testing further compounds for us. Although it came as a bit of shock but later it felt less so. Later, I’ve decided that it would still be part of my portfolio to showcase a project that did not proceed further (or in plain words, in the “failed” section).\nReflecting back to the whole experience for this project, I’ve learned my lessons about working with collaborators whose research focus was on entirely different but related field (their one was on molecular biology, while our side was on chemistry, I’ve been spending time working in both computer and chemistry labs, trying to identify likely compound candidate from molecular modelling and then synthesise the compounds in the lab for them to test). There should have been more communications if possible and perhaps we could’ve terminated the project earlier if needed so that we could allocate more time to work on other research project that better suited to the situation of our lab group. To have a closure for this project, I’ve written up a chapter about it in my PhD thesis to show what have been done and what other future work can be added if we have all the time and money in the world.\nImage: Rawpixel.com\nLink to MPhil thesis (beware: quite long)\nAbstract of this project:\nThe goal of this research project was to discover potential chemical compounds that could be further developed to become lead compounds to target secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1) and also sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The drug design process would need to be robust enough to ask the question; could a SERCA inhibitor be developed based on the drug design process involving molecular modelling, chemical synthesis and biological testing? If this first step was achieved then the next critical step was to design a SPCA1 inhibitor as SPCA1 was found to be highly involved in basal-like breast cancer. The potential lead compounds would then have the opportunity to become novel anti-cancer agents targeting basal-like breast cancer in this context. The ultimate aim was to widen the current therapeutic agents available for patients with basal-like subtype of breast cancer in the hope to further improve their quality of life and life expectancy."

I’m not used to posting anything on social media as I almost always prefer to stay low-profile, rather than the opposite, and this may not be a good thing especially if I’m trying to transition into a different job field. So I did it finally…\n\n\n\nPhoto by visuals on Unsplash\n\n\nOne of the reasons that I’ve finally decided to post on Twitter is that I’ve heard about the active and friendly R community on Twitter and thought if I could get any feedbacks on my short piece of work in R then that’ll be helpful for me to see if I’ve missed or done anything incorrectly since there’s not really a mentor person around that is able to do this at the moment (I’ve dreadfully taken the self-learning route, rather than attending data science bootcamps or get “another” degree, which is something I’m not really fancied at doing again, after already having MPhil and PhD already…). Luckily, I did get one helpful response and with a small number of likes so perhaps I’m not doing it entirely wrong (hopefully). My future plans will likely be trying to do a #TidyTuesday data visualisation and post whenever I can to learn and grow.\nI’ve also recently edited my rare disease drug projects in R and Python to add summaries of findings from these two projects so it’s easier for anyone to read, especially if there’s not really much time to go through long threads of codes in GitHub. I’m also currently working on another project in the rare diseases series on phenotypes associated with rare diseases from Orphanet. My plan at the moment is to use Python to clean the data (I’ve tried to load it in RStudio via a URL with XML file, it’s &gt;4000 rows and taking quite a long time to run on my laptop, so will stick to Python on Anaconda as it has loaded a lot faster than RStudio, then perhaps once it’s cleaned, I’ll re-import it back into RStudio for analysis and visualisations).\n\n\n\n Back to top"

In simple words, there were two main research projects going on concurrently in my PhD:\n\nSERCA project (details in a separate post as named)\nFilamenting temperature-sensitive Z protein project (also known as FtsZ project)\n\nFtsZ project was not a new project at the time, but rather a continuation from my previous predecessors in the lab group. Its primary focus was to look for other novel anti-bacterial hit compounds that were different from the ones that were already synthesised and tested in the group. This project was better than the SERCA project in a way that the collaborators were much easier to communicate with even though they were based in India. One down side was that because they’re based overseas, it did take a long time for the compound testing to happen and to have the results returned on time. However, overall, there were much more progress in this project which involved 3 main iterative stages:\nComputational work – involved molecular/homology modelling, virtual compound screening (compound size roughly in several 100,000s, please see below links for details) and compound selection for synthesis (using Schrödinger software mainly for this first stage of work)\nCompound synthesis – this was certainly the part that has painstakingly taken a lot of time in a chemistry lab out of my four years with many failures in between but with some successes in the end obviously…\nCompound testing – it was mainly done by our research collaborators After the completion of these two projects, I was less of a research newbie but I would still humbly call myself a junior researcher, considering how the field of drug discovery can have such an unfathomable depth and breadth…\n\n\n\nImage taken by author\n\n\nThe image above was taken literally when I packed up everything after I’ve completed my PhD, which was physically summed into this little box, but what I’ve gained from the journey was far bigger than this. The two hardcover books on the left hand side were my MPhil and PhD theses (potentially useful as treatment for insomnia due to their lengths and time required to read)."

Importantly, this app can exist outside a Jupyter notebook environment with internet required to access the app.\nThis is also the first part prior to the next post which will showcase the actual app. This part mainly involves some data cleaning but not as a major focus for this post.

    "text": "Coding for Shinylive app in Python\nThe entire code for this Shiny app in Python were written in VS Code initially. When I was looking for places to deploy the app, I then migrated the code to RStudio IDE (note: recently I saw Python code in Quarto documents being used in VS Code after I’ve deployed this app, so this might be another option).\nFor data preparation stage, please visit this post for details.\n\n\nTrialling open-source large-language models\nThere have been a lot of hypes surrounding large-language models (LLMs) or generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). I’m still somewhat both reserved and excited about them at present. The area I’m most concerned with is where are the relevant laws, regulations and ethics on using these tools in public domains, whether for private or commercial uses, and will they be country-specific or globally streamlined? While I have these questions in mind, I’m not denying the fact that they can be useful for a few well-known purposes in coding, such as requesting for regex code templates for text cleaning or asking for code snippets while programmers are busy with several tasks at the same time.\nI thought to trial out the open-source LLMs a little bit when I was working on this app, since they were the open and transparent versions with potentials for personal or commercial uses. So I’ve tested about 3 different open-source LLMs, which were H2OGPT, HuggingChat and StableLM. I decided to only give minimal amount of prompts (I’ve given H2OGPT three prompts, and only one prompt each for either HuggingChat and StableLM), and the question was framed around providing a code outline for building a Shiny app using Python and Polars dataframe libary, and see what answers they could each provide.\nAll of them produced answers that were close to what I’ve asked for, i.e. I could see a code outline for a Shiny app.py file at first but it was more like R code, with one case mixing both Python and R in the code concurrently. However, none of them actually reached exactly how I’ve asked them to provide, perhaps if I’ve given more prompts then they might manage to provide answers closer to the request. Also, none of them were able to pick up the more recent Polars dataframe library (which were probably more prominent from 2021 onwards) and also Shiny in Python (which was also quite new as well, only out of alpha phase recently). All of them only showed code using Pandas dataframe libray, even though I did mention Polars in all of the question prompts. Once I get to use more of these open-source LLMs in the future, which currently are gaining more traction from what I’ve read online, I think I might try to write another post about them later.\n\n\n\nUsing Shiny in Python documentations\nAfter trialling open-source LLMs a bit to help with the coding part (although not as helpful as I first imagined, but they still somewhat provided a rough code framework for Shiny apps), I completed the app.py script in the end by using mainly documents from Shiny for Python website. I still think thorough documentations for any products are still fundamental and inevitable, because these documentations will be sources to provide high-quality data for training these LLMs which means they’ll be of higher quality too.\nSeveral links I’ve used and found to be very informative:\n\n“Shiny for Python out of alpha” - quick summary on recent status update and new features such as shinyswatch and shinywidgets on Shiny for Python\n“Quickstart for R users” - a very useful link for people who are R users or already familiar with Shiny apps in R, and would like to build Shiny apps in Python\n“Shinylive: Shiny + WebAssembly” - great for understanding Shinylive\n“Shinylive applications embedded in Quarto documents” - this is all about embedding shinylive app in Quarto - the webpage link provided here is from this GitHub repository on Quarto extension for shinylive\n\n\n\n\n\nApp deployment\nAfter building the app in a workable condition, I started looking at where and how to deploy this Shiny app written in Python. Initially I used the easiest method as stated from the Shinylive link above, which was to deploy on Shinylive editor. One drawback for this was that the application URL was extremely long as the URL hash would store the entire app code inside. However, this was indeed one of the simplest ways to share the apps with others quickly, by simply providing the URL link with the intended audience.\nI then went on to try another method where I spent one afternoon trying to figure out that I had to add an install_certificate.command for my operating system since I installed Python by using Homebrew in the first place (which some clever users might already know to avoid…), so that I could resolve the SSL certificate issue if I’m trying to connect with Shinyapps.io.\nI also tried to follow another method from an earlier time which suggested to deploy the app directly on GitHub Pages, but since then the code was changed and updated to a different version and the old method no longer worked as nicely as mentioned (a lot of the code for Shiny in Python can still be experimental, and can change drastically, so check the sources to see the latest updates). I then stumbled upon another GitHub repository from the Quarto team at Posit/RStudio and looked into the possibility and tested it. Eventually, I settled on this method - embedding the app in a Quarto document, which provided both code and app itself on this very same webpage down below.\nOne of the downsides of the following code that I couldn’t quite get rid of yet was the poor file importation style. for loading a .csv file locally. I’ve added code annotations as comments to explain what I’ve done. The solution to import .csv file into app.py for the embedding version was from this discussion in the repository (thanks to that particular user who found this hacky way to do it). However, the plus side was that coding for the rest of the app was not bad at all and worked seamlessly. I’ll try to follow up later on whether importing .csv file for app embedding could be easier, perhaps this might be something the Quarto team is working right now.\nThe second downside was that shinyswatch package might not be functional yet for this embedding method (but most likely would work if deploying apps to shinyapps.io). This meant there would be no background visual themes yet for apps embedded in Quarto docs, but hopefully this would be possible in the future. Overall, I was amazed at how easy it was to build, deploy and embed a Shiny app in Python in a Quarto document.\nNote: if using Shinylive editor, make sure to include a requirement.txt file if using extra Python packages such as Pandas or Plotly. For embedding apps in Quarto docs, this appears not to be compulsory and only optional when I tried it down below.\nCode for this post (.qmd document) is available here.\n\n\nShinylive app in action\nNote: it may take a few minutes to load the app (code provided at the top, with app at the bottom).\nUpdate on 24/5/23: to avoid manual file input, see this updated post which uses pyodide.http.open_url() method (code change in editor section).\n\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources:

    "text": "Brief introduction\nSince I’ve had a lot of fun building a Shiny app in R last time, I was on track to build another Shiny app again but using Python instead. So here in this post, I’ll talk about the data wrangling process to prepare the final dataset needed to build a Shinylive app in Python. The actual Shinylive app deployment and access will be shown in a separate post after this one.\n\n\n\nSource of data\nThe dataset used for this Shiny app in Python was from PubChem (link here). There were a total of 631 compounds at the time when I downloaded them as .csv file, along with their relevant compound data. I only picked this dataset randomly, as the focus would be more on app building, but it was nice to see an interactive web app being built and used for a domain such as pharmaceutical research.\n\n\n\nImport Polars\nPolars dataframe library was used again this time.\n\nimport polars as pl\n\n\n\n\nReading .csv file\n\npc = pl.read_csv(\"pubchem.csv\")\npc.head()\n\n\n\nshape: (5,

compound was structurally\nPartition coefficients (xlogp) - predicted octanol-water partition coefficient as a measure of the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a molecule\nHeavy atom count - number of heavy atoms e.g. non-hydrogen atoms in the compound\nHydrogen bond donor count - number of hydrogen bond donors in the compound\nHydrogen bond acceptor count - number of hydrogen bond acceptors in the compound\nRotatable bond count - defined as any single-order non-ring bond, where atoms on either side of the bond were in turn bound to non-terminal heavy atoms (e.g. non-hydrogen). Rotation around the bond axis would change overall molecule shape and generate conformers which could be distinguished by standard spectroscopic methods\nExact mass - exact mass of an isotopic species, obtained by summing masses of individual isotopes of the molecule\nMonoisotopic mass - sum of the masses of atoms in a molecule, using unbound, ground-state, rest mass of principal (or most abundant) isotope for each element instead of isotopic average mass\nFormal charge - the difference between the number of valence electrons of each atom, and the number of electrons the atom was associated with, assumed any shared electrons were equally shared between the two bonded atoms\nCovalently-bonded unit count - a group of atoms connected by covalent bonds, ignoring other bond types (or a single atom without covalent bonds), representing number of such units in the compound\nIsotope atom count - number of isotopes that were not most abundant for the corresponding chemical elements. Isotopes were variants of a chemical element that differed in neutron number\nDefined atom stereocenter count - atom stereocenter (or chiral center) was where an atom was attached to 4 different types of atoms or groups of atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. It could either be (R)- or (S)- configurations. Some of the compounds e.g. racemic mixtures, could have undefined atom stereocenter, where (R/S)-config was not specifically defined. Defined atom stereocenter count was the number of atom stereocenters where configurations were specifically defined\nUndefined atoms stereocenter count - this was the undefined version of the atoms stereocenter count\nDefined bond stereocenter count - bond stereocenter (or non-rotatable bond) was where two atoms could have different arrangement e.g. in cis- & trans- forms of butene around its double bond. Some compounds could have an undefined bond stereocenter (stereochemistry not specifically defined). Defined bond stereocenter count was the number of bond stereocenters where configurations were specifically defined.\nUndefined bond stereocenter count - this was the undefined version of the bond stereocenter count\n\n\n\n\nConvert data type for selected columns\n\n# Convert data type - only for partition coefficients column (rest were okay)\npc_cov = pc_cov.with_column((pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\")).cast(pl.Float64, strict = False))\npc_cov.head()\n\n\n\nshape: (5, 38)\n\n\n\n\ncid\n\n\nCompound name\n\n\nSynonyms\n\n\nMolecular weight\n\n\nMolecular formula\n\n\nPolar surface area\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\nPartition coefficients\n\n\nHeavy atom count\n\n\nHydrogen bond donor count\n\n\nHydrogen bond acceptor count\n\n\nRotatable bond count\n\n\ninchi\n\n\nisosmiles\n\n\ncanonicalsmiles\n\n\ninchikey\n\n\niupacname\n\n\nExact mass\n\n\nMonoisotopic mass\n\n\nFormal charge\n\n\nCovalently-bonded unit count\n\n\nIsotope atom count\n\n\nTotal atom stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined atom stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined atoms stereocenter count\n\n\nTotal bond stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\npclidcnt\n\n\ngpidcnt\n\n\nMeSH headings\n\n\nannothits\n\n\nannothitcnt\n\n\naids\n\n\ncidcdate\n\n\nsidsrcname\n\n\ndepcatg\n\n\nannotation\n\n\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5280453\n\n\n\"Calcitriol\"\n\n\n\"calcitriol|322...\n\n\n416.6\n\n\n\"C27H44O3\"\n\n\n60.7\n\n\n688.0\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n30\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\n\n\"InChI=1S/C27H4...\n\n\n\"C[C@H](CCCC(C)...\n\n\n\"CC(CCCC(C)(C)O...\n\n\n\"GMRQFYUYWCNGIN...\n\n\n\"(1R,3S,5Z)-5-[...\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n22311\n\n\n46029\n\n\n\"Calcitriol\"\n\n\n\"Biological Tes...\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"485|631|731|78...\n\n\n20040916\n\n\n\"A2B Chem|AA BL...\n\n\n\"Chemical Vendo...\n\n\n\"COVID-19, COVI...\n\n\n\n\n9962735\n\n\n\"Ubiquinol\"\n\n\n\"ubiquinol|992-...\n\n\n865.4\n\n\n\"C59H92O4\"\n\n\n58.9\n\n\n1600.0\n\n\n20.2\n\n\n63\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n31\n\n\n\"InChI=1S/C59H9...\n\n\n\"CC1=C(C(=C(C(=...\n\n\n\"CC1=C(C(=C(C(=...\n\n\n\"QNTNKSLOFHEFPK...\n\n\n\"2-[(2E,6E,10E,...\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n0\n\n\n2732\n\n\n21358\n\n\n\"NULL\"\n\n\n\"Chemical and P...\n\n\n7\n\n\n\"NULL\"\n\n\n20061025\n\n\n\"001Chemical|A2...\n\n\n\"Chemical Vendo...\n\n\n\"COVID-19, COVI...\n\n\n\n\n5961\n\n\n\"Glutamine\"\n\n\n\"L-glutamine|gl...\n\n\n146.14\n\n\n\"C5H10N2O3\"\n\n\n106.0\n\n\n146.0\n\n\n-3.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"InChI=1S/C5H10...\n\n\n\"C(CC(=O)N)[C@@...\n\n\n\"C(CC(=O)N)C(C(...\n\n\n\"ZDXPYRJPNDTMRX...\n\n\n\"(2S)-2,5-diami...\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n88218\n\n\n399\n\n\n\"Glutamine\"\n\n\n\"Biological Tes...\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"422|429|436|54...\n\n\n20040916\n\n\n\"001Chemical|3B...\n\n\n\"Chemical Vendo...\n\n\n\"COVID-19, COVI...\n\n\n\n\n2244\n\n\n\"Aspirin\"\n\n\n\"aspirin|ACETYL...\n\n\n180.16\n\n\n\"C9H8O4\"\n\n\n63.6\n\n\n212.0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n13\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\"InChI=1S/C9H8O...\n\n\n\"CC(=O)OC1=CC=C...\n\n\n\"CC(=O)OC1=CC=C...\n\n\n\"BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ...\n\n\n\"2-acetyloxyben...\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n127012\n\n\n364455\n\n\n\"Aspirin\"\n\n\n\"Biological Tes...\n\n\n12\n\n\n\"1|3|9|15|19|21...\n\n\n20040916\n\n\n\"001Chemical|3B...\n\n\n\"Chemical Vendo...\n\n\n\"COVID-19, COVI...\n\n\n\n\n457\n\n\n\"1-Methylnicoti...\n\n\n\"1-methylnicoti...\n\n\n137.16\n\n\n\"C7H9N2O+\"\n\n\n47.0\n\n\n136.0\n\n\n-0.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\"InChI=1S/C7H8N...\n\n\n\"C[N+]1=CC=CC(=...\n\n\n\"C[N+]1=CC=CC(=...\n\n\n\"LDHMAVIPBRSVRG...\n\n\n\"1-methylpyridi...\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n310\n\n\n674\n\n\n\"NULL\"\n\n\n\"Biological Tes...\n\n\n8\n\n\n\"61001|61002|14...\n\n\n20040916\n\n\n\"001Chemical|3B...\n\n\n\"Chemical Vendo...\n\n\n\"COVID-19, COVI...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect columns for data visualisations\nThe idea was really only keeping all the numerical columns for some data visualisations later.

assignments in Polars\nThe longer I’ve used Polars, the more I like its coding styles of chaining a string of different code functions together to manipulate dataframes in one go. This usually might mean that we could avoid writing some repeated loop functions to achieve the same results. In the example below, I’d like to show how to chain “when-then-otherwise” expressions by using Polars.\n\n\nChaining when-then-otherwise expressions - creating groups in data\nI had the idea of separating all data into 3 different ranges of partition coefficients, so that this could be shown visually in plots. One of the possible ways (other than writing a loop function), or really the long way, to do this might be like the code shown below:\n```{python}\npart_coef_1 = pc_cov.filter(pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") &lt;= -10)\npart_coef_2 = pc_cov.filter((pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") &gt;= -11) & (pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") &lt;= 5))\npart_coef_3 = pc_cov.filter(pl.col(\"Partition_coef\") &gt;= 6)\n```\nA shorter and probably more elegant way was to use the “when-then-otherwise” expression in Polars for conditional assignments (the following code snippet was adapted with thanks to the author of Polars, Ritchie Vink and also the good old Stack Overflow):\n\npc_cov = pc_cov.with_column(\n    pl.when((pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") &lt;= -10))\n    .then(\"Smaller than -10\")\n    .when((pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") &gt;= -11) & (pl.col(\"Partition coefficients\") &lt;= 5))\n    .then(\"Between -11 and 5\")\n    .otherwise(\"Larger than 6\")\n    .alias(\"Part_coef_group\")\n)\n\npc_cov.head(10)\n\n# a new column would be added to the end of the dataframe \n# with a new column name, \"Part_coef_group\" \n# (scroll to the very right to see the added column)\n\n\n\nshape: (10, 21)\n\n\n\n\nCompound name\n\n\nMolecular weight\n\n\nPolar surface area\n\n\nComplexity\n\n\nPartition coefficients\n\n\nHeavy atom count\n\n\nHydrogen bond donor count\n\n\nHydrogen bond acceptor count\n\n\nRotatable bond count\n\n\nExact mass\n\n\nMonoisotopic mass\n\n\nFormal charge\n\n\nCovalently-bonded unit count\n\n\nIsotope atom count\n\n\nTotal atom stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined atom stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined atoms stereocenter count\n\n\nTotal bond stereocenter count\n\n\nDefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\nUndefined bond stereocenter count\n\n\nPart_coef_group\n\n\n\n\nstr\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nf64\n\n\nf64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\ni64\n\n\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Calcitriol\"\n\n\n416.6\n\n\n60.7\n\n\n688.0\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n30\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n416.329\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Ubiquinol\"\n\n\n865.4\n\n\n58.9\n\n\n1600.0\n\n\n20.2\n\n\n63\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n31\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n864.7\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n9\n\n\n9\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Glutamine\"\n\n\n146.14\n\n\n106.0\n\n\n146.0\n\n\n-3.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n146.069\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Aspirin\"\n\n\n180.16\n\n\n63.6\n\n\n212.0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n13\n\n\n1\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n180.042\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"1-Methylnicoti...\n\n\n137.16\n\n\n47.0\n\n\n136.0\n\n\n-0.1\n\n\n10\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n137.071\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Losartan\"\n\n\n422.9\n\n\n92.5\n\n\n520.0\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n30\n\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n8\n\n\n422.162\n\n\n422.162\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Vitamin E\"\n\n\n430.7\n\n\n29.5\n\n\n503.0\n\n\n10.7\n\n\n31\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n12\n\n\n430.381\n\n\n430.381\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Larger than 6\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Nicotinamide\"\n\n\n122.12\n\n\n56.0\n\n\n114.0\n\n\n-0.4\n\n\n9\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n122.048\n\n\n122.048\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Adenosine\"\n\n\n267.24\n\n\n140.0\n\n\n335.0\n\n\n-1.1\n\n\n19\n\n\n4\n\n\n8\n\n\n2\n\n\n267.097\n\n\n267.097\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\"Inosine\"\n\n\n268.23\n\n\n129.0\n\n\n405.0\n\n\n-1.3\n\n\n19\n\n\n4\n\n\n7\n\n\n2\n\n\n268.081\n\n\n268.081\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\"Between -11 an...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Plotly\nTime for some data vizzes -

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThis is really a short post (note) for myself and probably for others who may be interested in software tools to visualise in silico macromolecules and small molecules.\nMost bioinformaticians or structural biologists are probably already familiar with this software package, Molstar or Mol* (Sehnal et al. 2021). Molstar is a 3D viewer for large macromolecules (e.g. proteins), which are commonly used in structural biology and drug discovery (and also other related scientific disciplines).\nA Quarto extension has been developed to embed the Molstar interactive 3D viewer inside Quarto markdown documents, which can be rendered as HTML pages. The main advantage of this is that it’s useful for reports or presentations.\n\n\n\nSome useful links\n\nMolstar webpage: https://molstar.org/\nGitHub repository for the Quarto extension (thanks to the contributing team for this extension!): https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-molstar - example provided https://jmbuhr.de/quarto-molstar/\nOther Molstar example: https://ljmartin.github.io/sideprojects/dockviz2.html\nR Shiny and Molstar example (for people who prefer using R and R Shiny): https://www.appsilon.com/post/shiny-molstar-r-package-molecular-structures-visualizations\nStreamlit and Dash integrations are also possible, this also makes me think that I could probably try integrating Molstar with Shiny for Python, it’ll likely be a future side project.\n\n\n\n\nAn example using Molstar with RCSB PDB\nThe following example retrieves a protein (PDB ID: 4MQT) from RCSB PDB.\n{{&lt; mol-rcsb 4mqt &gt;}}\n    \n    \n    \nHover over protein structure to see details of amino acid residues or ligands present in the structure.\nTo focus or zoom-in on the ligand bound to the receptor, just click on the ligand first. This shows most of the chemical interactions between the receptor and ligand bound to it (e.g. hydrogen bondings, other chemical interactions will appear if present e.g. pi-pi stacking).\nScreenshots or state snapshots are also available from the viewer (other utility functions can be found on the top right corner of the viewer).\n\n\n\nAn close-up screenshot of 4MQT showing bound ligand\n\n\nMD trajectories are also available, although I haven’t quite got there yet but it’s useful to know this may be possible (see example C from https://molstar.org/viewer-docs/examples/).\nIt’s also possible to upload AlphaFold-sourced proteins, or from other file sources (see examples shown from Molstar example).\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nSehnal, David, Sebastian Bittrich, Mandar Deshpande, Radka Svobodová, Karel Berka, Václav Bazgier, Sameer Velankar, Stephen K Burley, Jaroslav Koča, and Alexander S Rose. 2021. “Mol* Viewer: Modern Web App for 3D Visualization and Analysis of Large Biomolecular Structures.” Nucleic Acids Research 49 (W1): W431–37. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab314."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After my PhD study came to an end at around the end of 2018 to early 2019, I’ve decided to return to New Zealand. This was followed by my tumultuous postdoc searching story and also a solitude time for myself to dig deeper into what I would really like to do research-wise. This, of course, then led to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which in a sense has been world-changing (I don’t know what other words or terms can better describe it) and its after-effect is still hanging around until this very moment…\nRegarding to the postdoc job searching, this has made me ponder really hard about what sort of research I would really like to work on. As I’ve spent time preparing my CV, writing different cover letters, applying for different postdoc-related roles and also after being invited to five job interviews, I’ve decided that it was not quite enough about what I’ve done so far in Masters and PhD work… I’m still lacking some skills. I’ve also realised that I do not necessarily like the traditional academic postdoc work (discovered while and after I’ve applied for numerous postdoc posts in 2019) and also I’m more inclined to work on computational chemistry and cheminformatics side of research.\nAnother “elephant-in-the-room” issue was that it has been very difficult to publish a first-author paper from my PhD research work, due to the impact from the development of COVID-19 pandemic for the last two years (my overseas-based collaborators have been hit hard particularly and they were still working on part of the experiments until the first quarter of the year 2021) and hence probably this was the most likely the reason that I did not get final offers in some academic postdoc positions, due to the lack of first-author papers.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sergi Kabrera on Unsplash\n\n\nBecause of all the issues and problems, I’ve still kept my old pharmacist job as my side job while I start on a new journey in learning data science. I’ve tested the water since 2019 and temporarily ceased the learning in 2020 due to the pandemic (I worked full-time in hospital which was also another unforgettable experience of course). From the last quarter of 2021, I’ve made up my mind to go full board with data science (as I can’t see my PhD research work being published any time soon so it’s time to consider a possible change in direction). I thought I’d like to learn about it systematically with some sort of logical structures in the course so that I can understand a basic full picture about it in a reasonably short time (I realise data science itself is a profound field) and if there are some sort of accreditations, this would be even better. This was also the sole reason why I started on Coursera’s IBM data science professional certificate in the last quarter of 2021. After learning more about it, I’ve realised how much it has overlapped with cheminformatics and my interests in both areas grew more and more as time goes.\nI have now completed the data science professional certificate, which consisted of a total of 10 courses with assessments, assignments and portfolios (certificates and/or IBM badges viewable from my LinkedIn profile). I have managed to finish the course within about 5 months (from mid-September 2021 till end of January 2022) while working part-time as a locum pharmacist. Although it’s not a perfect course, I think it reflects very nicely what the reality will be like when working as a data scientist or cheminformatician – imperfections in data sources, data analyses and presentations that need to be corrected or problems that need to be solved by looking for answers and working on possible solutions. I think it’s a useful course for newcomers who want to learn more about data science and also for the professionals who would like to refresh or reaffirm knowledge and skills (this is by no means a promotion about Coursera’s data science course but just a personal learning experience only, other course providers may equally provide similar experiences and I would encourage anyone who’s interested to look around and see what other courses are available).\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Pills dataset - Part 3",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe aim of this final part (part 3) for the pills dataset was really for me to start using Rust in a beginner-friendly way. Overall, this trilogy (parts 1 - 3) for the pills dataset formulated an overview of how to use Polars in Python (mainly), Pandas in Python (smaller section) and Polars in Rust (even little less as this was new to me) with Plotly. Over time, I’ve been finding myself learning more optimally by doing and applying, rather than just reading and thinking, so I’ve got myself started in this very new programming language, Rust, to get some familiarities. I anticipated that I would still work with Python and R mainly in the near future, so that I’m not diverting too much and would be at least proficient in at least one programming language.\nMy very initial idea was to integrate Rust-Polars, Plotly in Rust (Plotly.rs) and Jupyter-Evcxr together, and see if I could get a simple data visualisation out of a small dataset. Although the idea sounded simple enough, I was actually quite stuck at the step of importing one of the columns as x-axis variables in Rust-Polars to Plotly.rs. I figured it might possibly be due to my very lack-of-knowledge and lack-of-familiarities with Rust (I do need to continue reading the Rust programming language book), Polars (I’m better with Python-Polars actually), Plotly.rs and also Evcxr. Another possibility could be that Plotly.rs mainly had ndarray support, and Polars was not mentioned explicitly in Plotly.rs so my guess was that these two might not flow very well together. Also, Polars itself was constantly evolving and growing as well.\nSo I’ve decided to leave things as how it would be for now, before I delayed this post any further. If I happened to figure out how to do this in the future, then I’ll come back to update this last part of the project. While I was tackling this little issue mentioned above, somehow I’ve managed to deconstruct Polars dataframe in Rust in Evcxr. So I’ll show a little bit about it below. One slightly good news that came out from all of this, was that I’ve managed to import the other column as y-axis variables, which contained numbers, without problems. I’ve also figured out the Rust code to convert Series/ChunkedArray to vectors in Rust IDEs (e.g. VS Code, and quite a few others). So I did learn a few things while completing this post, and hoped I could expand further on this later.\nNote: I’ve published all Rust code as print-only in Quarto markdown file, since it’s not possible to run them in RStudio IDE (Rust was not supported). So all Rust code were originally run on Jupyter Lab in MacOS, with code outputs being captured as screenshots, which were shown as photos in this post. Here’s the link to the .ipynb file in the GitHub repository for this portfolio website (or alternatively, you could access it from the GitHub icon link at the top of the web page), in case anyone wanted to see the full .ipynb version.\n\n\n\nImport dependencies\nThese dependencies were known as crates in the world of Rust. I’d also like to think of them as libraries or packages we would install or import in Python and R. So this step was necessary before I even started anything decent in Rust. Similar things would also apply to Rust IDEs as well since I’ve played a little bit in VS Code previously.\n```{rust}\n// Set up required dependencies\n:dep ndarray = \"0.15.6\"\n```\n```{rust}\n:dep plotly = { version = \"&gt;=0.8.0\", features = [\"plotly_ndarray\"]}\n```\n```{rust}\n// May take a few minutes to load polars crate (might depend on your machine specs)\n:dep polars = { version = \"&gt;=0.26.0\", features = [\"lazy\", \"csv-file\", \"strings\", \"dtype-duration\", \"dtype-categorical\", \"concat_str\", \"rank\", \"lazy_regex\", \"ndarray\"]}\n```\n```{rust}\n:dep itertools = {version = \"0.9.0\"}\n```\n\n\n\nImport external crates\n```{rust}\n// Import external crates needed\nextern crate ndarray;\nextern crate plotly;\nextern crate polars;\n```\n\n\n\nSpecify imports or modules required\n```{rust}\nuse ndarray::prelude::*;\nuse polars::prelude::*;\nuse plotly::common::{\n    ColorScale, ColorScalePalette, DashType, Fill, Font, Line, LineShape, Marker, Mode, Title,\n};\nuse plotly::layout::{Axis, BarMode, Layout, Legend, TicksDirection};\nuse plotly::{Plot, Scatter, Bar};\nuse itertools::Itertools;\n```\n\n\n\nReading csv file\nHere, I’ve imported the .csv file saved from part 2 of the project.\n```{rust}\n// Reading .csv file\nlet df = CsvReader::from_path(\"ace_para_count.csv\").unwrap().finish().unwrap();\n```\n```{rust}\ndf\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting columns into ndarrays\nI’ve tested plotting in Plotly.rs after a few trials and errors at the beginning, but luckily I’ve spotted the ndarray support from the Plotly.rs book soon enough to figure out that I could convert the “count” column into a ndarray first, which was shown in the code below.\n```{rust}\n// Switch Polars dataframe into 2D array\n// Ensure \"ndarray\" was added as one of the features for polars under dependencies\n\n/*Example from Polars documentation:\nlet df = DataFrame::new(vec![a, b]).unwrap();\nlet ndarray = df.to_ndarray::&lt;Float64Type&gt;().unwrap();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ndarray);\n*/\n\n//Note: ndarray for numbers only, not strings, so only \"count\" column was converted\nlet ndarray = df.to_ndarray::&lt;Float64Type&gt;().unwrap();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", ndarray);\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nDeconstructing Polars dataframe in Rust\nBecause “to_ndarray” was only for numerics and not strings, I ran into a problem trying to figure out how to best import this other “Colour” column into Plotly.rs. This led to my little convoluted journey to work with Polars dataframe in Rust, trying to see if I could convert the “Colour” column into a vector (which might not be the best way to do it, but as part of my Rust learning, I went for it anyway). I’ve subsequently tried plotting the “count” column in ndarray as a vector with success, based on the reference from Plotly.rs book that variables for x or y-axis could be placed into a vector by using a vector macro. Eventually, I didn’t quite achieve my goal but I’ve managed to break down or convert the Polars dataframe into different formats.\n```{rust}\n// Select specific column or series by position\nlet Colours = df[0].clone();\n\n//Alternative way to select specific column or series by name\n//let u = df.select_series(&[\"Colour\"]);\n```\n```{rust}\nColours\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThere was a mention of storing series (column) in a vec (as series vector, not vector for strings) in Polars’ documentation, which I’ve tried to plot in Plotly.rs, but it unfortunately failed to work. One of my guesses could be due to the data type used for vector, as Rust was a very type-specific programming language, which also brought its well-known memory safety and other benefits in the long run. My immediate thought was that it probably needed to be a vector for strings, not series, which might make it work. Then I was searching on StackOverflow for similar questions and answers, then I found something related to what I wanted to do from Polars documentations as shown below.\n```{rust}\n// Adapted from: https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/docs/eager/index.html#series \n// Extracting data: \n// To be able to extract data out of Series, \n// either by iterating over them or converting them to other datatypes like a Vec&lt;T&gt;, \n// we first need to downcast them to a ChunkedArray&lt;T&gt;. \n// This is needed because we don't know the data type that is held by the Series.\n\n/*use polars::prelude::*; \n  use polars::df;\n\n  fn extract_data() -&gt; PolarsResult&lt;()&gt; { \n  let df = df! [ \"a\" =&gt; [None, Some(1.0f32), Some(2.0)], \"str\" =&gt; [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"ham\"]]?;\n\n// first extract ChunkedArray to get the inner type.\n\n  let ca = df.column(\"a\")?.f32()?;\n\n// Then convert to vec\n\n  let _to_vec: Vec&lt;Option&lt;f32&gt;&gt; = Vec::from(ca);\n\n// We can also do this with iterators\n\n  let ca = df.column(\"str\")?.utf8()?; \n  let _to_vec: Vec&lt;Option&lt;&str&gt;&gt; = ca.into_iter().collect(); \n  let _to_vec_no_options: Vec&lt;&str&gt; = ca.into_no_null_iter().collect();\n\n  Ok(())\n\n}*/\n```\nInitially, I trialled the iterator function first.\n```{rust}\n// Print out items in column by applying an iterator to it\nprintln!(\"{}\", &Colours.iter().format(\"\\n\"));\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThen, it took me quite a long time to just downcast Series into ChunkedArray, but somehow I’ve managed to figure out the code myself below. One of the likely reasons was due to my choice of using Evcxr, which required Rust code in slightly different formats than the ones in Rust IDEs (although almost the same).\n```{rust}\n// Somehow worked out how to convert series to chunkedarray by accident!\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", Colours.utf8().unwrap());\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nThen I moved onto trying to figure out how to convert or place a ChunkedArray into a vector, with the closest answer shown below. However, bear in mind that these Rust code were for Rust IDEs, and not for Evcxr, so this added slightly more complexities to what I was trying to do (perhaps I should just stick with Rust IDEs in the future…).\n```{rust}\n//Adpated from StackOverflow - How to get a Vec from polars Series or ChunkedArray?\n//You can collect the values into a Vec.\n\n/*use polars::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; { let s = Series::new(\"a\", 0..10i32);\n\n    let as_vec: Vec&lt;Option&lt;i32&gt;&gt; = s.i32()?.into_iter().collect();\n\n    //if we are certain we don't have missing values\n    let as_vec: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = s.i32()?.into_no_null_iter().collect();\n    Ok(())\n\n}*/\n```\nI also found another way to iterate the ChunkedArray.\n```{rust}\n//fn iter_forward(ca: &Float32Chunked) { ca.into_iter().for_each(|opt_v| println!(\"{:?}\", opt_v)) } \n```\nI then tested another iterator method, and came up with another line of code as shown below, which listed the colours in the “Colour” column.\n```{rust}\nColours.utf8().unwrap().into_iter().for_each(|array|println!(\"{:?}\", array));\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nI also found out, randomly, how to slice strings for Series in Polars. By changing the number of letters to slice through in Some(), the strings or words would vary length accordingly. Here, I’ve used “15” so it covered all the colours (note: the longest would be 12 characters for combination colours).\n```{rust}\n// Another method to use if needing to slice strings\nlet x = Colours.utf8().unwrap().str_slice(0, Some(15));\nx\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\nLastly, before I got too carried away, I just wanted to show the method from Polars documentations that this was the Polars’ way to select a specific column from Polars dataframe.\n```{rust}\nlet ca = df.clone().lazy().select([cols([\"Colour\"])]).collect()?;\nca\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Polars dataframe in Plotly.rs\nFor the x-axis, eventually, I reverted for manual input due to the issue mentioned in the background section. So the colours from the “Colour” column were stored in a vector set up manually, rather than coming directly from the dataframe. While searching for answers, I’ve also learnt several other tricks, although not really solving the problem, they might still be useful in the future. For the y-axis, the ndarray for the “count” column was converted into a vector first before being fed into the trace (graph module), and thankfully the plot worked nicely.\n```{rust}\n// MANUAL method:\n// Use vec! macro to create new vectors to hold x variables (words as strings)\n// Manually input the colour names (as ndarray is only for numbers)\nlet x = vec![\"RED\", \"ORANGE;BROWN\", \"YELLOW;WHITE\", \"ORANGE\", \"WHITE\", \"BLUE\"];\n\n// Plot using ndarray, which is supported by Plotly.rs \n// Polars likely not supported yet\n// Convert ndarray (holding counts as y variables) into vector \nlet y = ndarray.column(1).to_vec();\n\n// Use trace as a graph module,\n// choose type of plots needed for x & y variables called\n// Graph options e.g. Scatter, Line or Bar\nlet trace = Scatter::new(x, y);\n\n// Set plot variable as mutable and initiate a plot\nlet mut plot = Plot::new();\n// Add trace (graph) into the plot variable\nplot.add_trace(trace);\n\n// Specify the specs for plot\nlet layout = Layout::new()\n    // Choose height of graph\n    .height(500)\n    // Name x-axis\n    .x_axis(Axis::new().title(Title::new(\"Colours\")))\n    // Name y-axis\n    .y_axis(Axis::new().title(Title::new(\"Count\")))\n    // Add title of graph\n    .title(Title::new(\"Frequency of colours in acetaminophen (paracetamol) oral dosage forms\"));\n\n// Set the layout of the plot\nplot.set_layout(layout);\n\n// Display the plot in Jupyter Lab format \n// For Jupyter Notebook, use: plot.notebook_display();\nplot.lab_display();\nformat!(\"EVCXR_BEGIN_CONTENT application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\\n{}\\nEVCXR_END_CONTENT\", plot.to_json())\n```\n\n\n\nPhoto by author\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis last part was the hardest for me to execute out of all 3 parts (it likely took me a good whole week to figure out deconstructing Polars dataframe and trying to work with vectors), as Rust was completely new to me. At one point I thought about jumping back to Python, but I persisted and although I didn’t quite solve the string importation issue, I was somehow happy that I was at least able to see how this programming language could be applied in Polars dataframe library. I also got a taste of using Rust in data visualisations. All I wanted to show was that there were a variety of data tools to use, and knowing your tools of trade would be the most critical when working on different data projects as certain tools would only work the best for certain tasks and scenarios. This warm-up lesson in Rust was quite interesting and I might continue either in VS Code or Evcxr depending on my next topic of interest.\n\n\n\nReferences\nRust programming language book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html\nPolars crate documentations: https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/\nPlotly.rs GitHub repository: https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly (link to the Plotly.rs book can be found in “Converting columns into ndarrays” section)\nEvcxr GitHub repository: https://github.com/google/evcxr\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Introduction\nAs mentioned in my last project, I’ve tried using Evcxr, which provided a way to use Rust interactively in a Jupyter environment. The name, “Evcxr”, was quite hard to remember at first. It was pronounced as “e-vic-ser” according to the author, which I’ve randomly come across in an online tech interview when I was looking into it. I’ve also sort of worked out a way to memorise its spelling by taking specific letters out of “evaluation context for rust” (which was what it was called in its GitHub repository).\nFor users of Jupyter Notebook/Lab and Python, they might be quite used to the working speed of the cell outputs. However, one thing I’ve noticed when I was using Evcxr or Rust kernel in Jupyter Lab was that the speed of cell outputs was noticeably slower (especially at the beginning while loading all the dependencies required). The speed improved when loading external crates and modules, and generally it was faster afterward.\nDue to this reason (note: I did not look into any other optimising strategies for this and this could be restricted to my computer hardware specs, so this might differ for other users), I think Evcxr was not ideal for a very large and complex data science project yet (however if its ecosystem kept developing, it might be improved in the future). One thing of note was that when I was combing through issues in Evcxr’s GitHub repository, someone mentioned the slow compile time of the Rust compiler, which would have likely caused the snail speed, but knowing that the actual program running speed was blazingly fast, some sacrifice at the beginning made sense to me. Overall, Rust was really a systems programming language with memory efficiency (with no garbage collector), type safety and concurrency as some of its notable advantages.\nBecause of the dependency loading issue in the Jupyter environment, and also knowing there was already a dataframe library built from Rust, I’ve opted to use Polars-Python again for the data wrangling part of this project. This was also accompanied by the good old Pandas library as well (under the section of “Transform web-scraped data into dataframe” if anyone wants to jump to that part to see the code). I then went on to trial using Rust via Evcxr for data visualisation based on a small dataframe by using Plotly.rs. This project would be separated into 3 parts:\n\nPart 1: Initial pillbox dataset loading and web-scraping\nPart 2: Data wrangling and mining for data visualisations\nPart 3: Using Rust for data visualisation\n\nThe main reason I wanted to try Evcxr was that I could see the potential of using Rust interactively to showcase the results in a relatively fast and efficient manner. This meant specific data exploratory results could reach wider audience, leading to more impacts in different fields, in a very broad term. Oppositely, for more specific users such as scientists or engineers, this meant experiments could be carried out in a safe and efficient manner, with test results readily available for future work planning.\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nThis time the dataset was spotted from Data Is Plural, specifically the 2022.11.30 edition. The section I was interested in was the first paragraph at the top, about “Pills”. By going into one of the links provided in the paragraph, this brought me to the Pillbox dataset from the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). The .csv file was downloaded via the “Export” button at the top right of the webpage.\nThis pillbox dataset was actually retired since 28th January 2021, but was still available for educational or research purposes only. Therefore, it was not recommended for pill identifications as the dataset was not up-to-date. Alternative resources such as DailyMed would be more appropriate for readers in the US (as one of the examples). For readers in other countries, local health professionals and resources would be recommended for up-to-date information.\n\n\n\nImporting library & dataset\n\n# Install/upgrade polars if needed

error message actually came up that showed, “…Could not parse ‘10.16’ as dtype Int64 at column 7…”. One way to get around this was to add “ignore_errors” to bypass this error first in order to load the dataset first. This error could be fixed when checking and converting data types for columns.\n\n\n\nInitial data wrangling\nThe Pillbox dataset link from NLM provided a list of column information for users. To quickly see what were the columns in the dataset, we could use “df.glimpse()” to read column names, data types and the first 10 items in each column.\n\nprint(df.glimpse())\n\nRows: 83925\nColumns: 55\n$ ID                   &lt;Int64&gt;

These dosage form code were hard to understand, so once I’ve got the code along with corresponding dosage forms in texts, the web-scraped information would be converted into a dataframe for further data manipulations.\n\n# Uncomment lines below to install libraries needed for web-scraping\n#!pip install requests\n#!pip install beautifulsoup4\n\n\nImport libraries\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\n\nI’ve opted for using Beautiful Soup as the web-scraping library in Python, along with the requests library to be able to make a URL request call to retrieve web information. There were of course many other tools available as well. A caveat to be taken into consideration was that when web-scraping, it was always recommended to check whether the information being scraped were under a specific copyright license and so on. In this case, I’ve checked that the dosage form table link - https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/dosage-forms was from US FDA and it was stated that the information (both texts and graphs) were not copyrighted (unless otherwise stated, for this particular web page, there was nothing stated along those lines), but a link to this webpage should be provided so that readers could access most current information in the future.\n\n\nSend web requests\n\n# Specify URL address with information intended for web-scraping\nurl = \"https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/dosage-forms\"\n# Request the web information via requests library & save under a data object\ndata =

might be useful later, the web content could be saved as a file as shown below.\n\n# Create a file by passing the request content into write () method\n# and save the dosage form table as a file in

    "text": "Why updating this post?\nThree reasons for this:\n\nChEMBL data downloaded straight from the ChEMBL database website is way too large to be uploaded to GitHub - this is one of my very early posts where ChEMBL is completely new to me at the time so I’ve downloaded the ChEMBL data without thinking too much, obviously there are other better and more reproducible ways to source ChEMBL data e.g. my more recent posts or through other ways in the literatures\nNote: GitHub blocks files larger than 100 MiB, which is in mebibytes and equivalent to 1,048,576 bytes or 1.04858 MB (reference) - my bad before as I’ve read “MiB” as “MB” from this GitHub doc!\nPolars seems to be a bit more integrated with scikit-learn now so I’m wondering if Polars dataframe library can be used with scikit-learn solely (i.e. not using Pandas at all)\nThis post is one of my earlier less mature posts (very embarrassing when I’m looking at it now…) so I just want to improve it a little at least\n\n\n\n\nPrevious post updates\nUpdate on 19th April 2024 - Polars is currently more integrated with scikit-learn from version 1.4 (since January 2024), see this link re. Polars output in set_output for Polars dataframe outputs in scikit-learn, and also a few other Polars enhancements from release version 1.4 changelog.\nUpdate on 16th August 2023 - some code updates only, please always refer to Polars API reference for most up-to-date code.\n\n\n\nBackground\nThis is the first part of the series of posts on building a logistic regression model by using scikit-learn with Polars dataframe library (note: the older version of this post also uses Pandas). Polars is a fast (or more commonly known as “blazingly fast”) dataframe library that is written completely in Rust with a very light Python binding that is available for use in Python or Rust programming language. Here I’ll be using Python throughout all posts in the series.\nThis post will only focus on getting the small molecules data ready from ChEMBL database via a straight website download (not recommended if you’re researching or doing virtual experiments that require a good level of data reproducibility, e.g. you’ll need the version of data etc., this is however only a demonstration so I’ll leave it as it is), and then convert the comma separated value (.csv) file into a parquet file (for better file compressions) in order to upload the data into GitHub.\n\n\n\nInstall and import Polars\n\n## To install Polars dataframe library (or install in virtual environments)\n#%pip install polars\n## Update Polars version\n#%pip install --upgrade polars\n\nimport polars as pl\npl.show_versions()\n\n--------Version info---------\nPolars:              1.9.0\nIndex type:          UInt32\nPlatform:            macOS-12.7.6-x86_64-i386-64bit\nPython:              3.11.0 (v3.11.0:deaf509e8f, Oct 24 2022, 14:43:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)]\n\n----Optional dependencies----\nadbc_driver_manager  \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\naltair               \n\n\n5.4.1\ncloudpickle          \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nconnectorx           \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\ndeltalake            \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nfastexcel            \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nfsspec               \n\n\n2024.6.1\ngevent               \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\ngreat_tables         \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nmatplotlib           \n\n\n3.9.2\nnest_asyncio         \n\n\n1.6.0\nnumpy                \n\n\n1.26.4\nopenpyxl             \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\npandas               \n\n\n2.1.4\npyarrow              \n\n\n17.0.0\npydantic             \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\npyiceberg            \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nsqlalchemy           \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\ntorch                \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nxlsx2csv             \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\nxlsxwriter           \n\n\n&lt;not installed&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload dataset\nThe file being used here will be equivalent to a straight download from the home page of ChEMBL database, via clicking on the “Distinct compounds” (see the circled area in the image below).

To read it properly, we can add a delimiter term in the code to transform the dataframe into a more readable format.\nAnother thing being added below is to deal with null values early - by filling in “None” and “” values in the dataframe as “null” first.

The explanations of the selected term are adapted from ChEMBL_31 schema documentation (available as “Release notes” on the website at the time), or if definitions for certain terms are not available, I resort to interpret them myself by going into “Dinstict compounds” section of the ChEMBL database.\nThe definitions for some of the listed physicochemical properties are:\nMax Phase - Maximum phase of development reached for the compound (where 4 = approved). Null is where max phase has not yet been assigned.\nBioactivities - Various biological assays used for the compounds e.g. IC50, GI50, potency tests etc.\nAlogP - Calculated partition coefficient\nHBA - Number of hydrogen bond acceptors\nHBD - Number of hydrogen bond donors\n#RO5 Violations - Number of violations of Lipinski’s rule-of-five, using HBA and HBD definitions\nPasses Ro3 - Indicating whether the compound passed the rule-of-three (MW &lt; 300, logP &lt; 3 etc)\nQED Weighted - Weighted quantitative estimate of drug likeness (Bickerton et al. 2012)\nInorganic flag - Indicating whether the molecule is inorganic (i.e., containing only metal atoms and &lt;2 carbon atoms), where 1 = inorganic compound and 0 = non-inorganic compound (-1 meaning preclinical compound or not a drug)\nHeavy Atoms - Number of heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms\nCX Acidic pKa - The most acidic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX Basic pKa - The most basic pKa calculated using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogP - The calculated octanol/water partition coefficient using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nCX LogD - The calculated octanol/water distribution coefficient at pH = 7.4 using ChemAxon v17.29.0\nStructure Type - based on compound_structures table, where SEQ indicates an entry in the protein_therapeutics table instead, NONE indicates an entry in neither tables, e.g. structure unknown\nInchi Key - the IUPAC international chemical identifier key\nThe older version of this post has had a code section for changing the data types of several columns. I’ve found out that this is no longer needed as I’ve taken care of this in the first post when I’ve specifically stated the null_values (e.g. “None” and ““) to be converted to”null” during pl.read_csv(). When the same dataframe df_pa is read here, you’ll notice that the data type for each column should be how it should be, matching the data inside each column.\n\n\n\n\nDealing with nulls\nI’m using null_count() to see the distributions of all null entries in the dataset.\n\n# Alternative code: df_pa.select(pl.all().null_count())\ndf_pa.null_count()\n\n\nshape: (1, 32)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nName\nSynonyms\nType\nMax Phase\nMolecular Weight\nTargets\nBioactivities\nAlogP\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\n#Rotatable Bonds\nPasses Ro3\nQED Weighted\nCX Acidic pKa\nCX Basic pKa\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nAromatic Rings\nStructure Type\nInorganic Flag\nHeavy Atoms\nHBA (Lipinski)\nHBD (Lipinski)\n#RO5 Violations (Lipinski)\nMolecular Weight (Monoisotopic)\nMolecular Species\nMolecular Formula\nSmiles\nInchi Key\n\n\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\nu32\n\n\n\n\n0\n1795946\n1753154\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n783038\n691442\n26560\n26560\n26426\n0\n0\n26426\n26426\n26426\n26426\n0\n43392\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is basically several different ways to remove null values from the original dataset.\n\n## ---Drop all rows with null entries---\n#df_pa.drop_nulls()\n\n## Number of rows reduced to 2,645 - seems way too much...\n\n## ---Restricting drop nulls to only subsets of nulls in strings ---\n# import polars.selectors as cs\n# df_pa.drop_nulls(subset=cs.string())\n\n## Number of rows reduced to 17,735 - hmm... try other ways?\n\n## ---Drop a row if all values are null---\n# df_pa.filter(~pl.all_horizontal(pl.all().is_null()))\n\n## No change in number of rows - meaning no one row contains all null values\n\n## ---Restricting drop nulls to a specific column---\n# df_pa.drop_nulls(subset=\"CX LogP\")\n\n## Number of rows reduced to 1,873,678\n\nInitially, I’ve tried to remove all nulls first, then I realise that removing nulls above may not be the best way to prepare the data as all max phase 4 compounds are actually also removed completely! So what I’m going to do instead is to keep them by using fill_null() to replace all “null” as “0” (this’ll only apply to all the integers or floats in the data).\n\ndf_pa =

at max phase and QED weighted\nTo explore some of the physicochemical and molecular properties in the dataframe, “Max Phase” is one of the first few that I want to have a look. Each ChEMBL compound will have a max phase number from 0 to 4 (for this particular dataset only, you’ll notice that this can start from -1 in other ChEMBL datasets), where 4 means the compound is approved (e.g. a prescription medicine).\nWhile looking at max phases, I’m thinking the compounds with max phase 0 could be a testing set for prediction of their max phase outcomes, while the max phase 4 compounds could be the training set for building a machine learning (ML) model. There are of course some obvious and potential flaws of splitting a dataset like this, please treat this as an exercise for demonstration only.\nBelow I’m checking that I do have max phases of molecules spanning across the entire range of 0 to 4.\n\n## Alternative code\n# df_pa.group_by(\"Max Phase\", maintain_order = True).agg(pl.len())\ndf_pa.group_by(\"Max Phase\").len()\n\n\nshape: (5, 2)\n\n\n\nMax Phase\nlen\n\n\ni64\nu32\n\n\n\n\n3\n773\n\n\n0\n1826345\n\n\n1\n520\n\n\n4\n2870\n\n\n2\n1052\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the other parameters I’m interested in is “QED Weighted” (Bickerton et al. 2012). It’s a measure of druglikeness for small molecules based on the concept of desirability, which is based on a total of 8 different molecular properties. These molecular properties include molecular weight, ALogP, polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of rotatable bonds, number of aromatic rings and structural alerts. It’s normally recorded as a number ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 is the least druglike and 1 being the most druglike.\n\n\n\nPrepare data prior to running ML model\nThe goal of this ML model is to answer this question - which physicochemical features may be useful to predict whether a compound may enter into max phase 4?\nA rough plan at this stage is:\n\nto filter out max phase 4 and 0 compounds from the df_pa dataset\nto use “Max Phase” as the target y variable for a logistic regression (LR) model because ultimately stakeholders are more likely to be interested in knowing which candidate compounds have the most likely chance to reach the final approved phase during a drug discovery project (please bear in mind that this ML model building is more like a demo only and may not reflect real-life scenarios…)\nto use “Polar Surface Area”, “HBA”, “HBD”, “#RO5 Violations”, “QED Weighted”, “CX LogP”, “CX LogD” and “Heavy atoms” as the training features for building the ML model (these molecular features are selected randomly and ideally I should include more… the first three are newly added in this updated version)\nto use max phase 0 compounds as the testing set since they are the ones not assigned with any max phase category yet\nto use max phase 4 compounds as the training set since they’ve reached the approved phase\nto build a confusion matrix in the end to see if the features selected may generate a somewhat reasonable model for predicting the outcomes of these small molecules\n\nDownsides of this plan are (there are many…):\n\nthe dataset used here may include some inorganic compounds (e.g. molecules containing metals)\nthe dataset is likely not very-chemically-diverse\nthere are only a small number of max phase 4 compounds for model training (especially comparing with the “much larger” amount of max phase 0 compounds present)\nLR may not be the best choice of ML model to start off with (I just wanted to find out how it works at the time and because I’m updating the post now so I’m trying to keep it the same…)\nother exploratory data analysis should be done really… e.g. how chemically diverse is the dataset?\nthis is only an exercise so will not be taking into account many other important aspects of drug discovery e.g. what disorders or illnesses are we targeting? (is it an experimentally validated and actually a suitable target?) and what have been done so far in the literatures? etc.\n\nFirstly, I’m filtering out all the max phase 0 compounds and also all the max phase 4 compounds then save them in separate dataframes.\n\n# Selecting all max phase 0 molecules with their training features\ndf_0 = df_pa.filter((pl.col(\"Max Phase\") == 0)).select([\n  \"ChEMBL ID\", \n  \"Max Phase\",\n  \"Polar Surface Area\",\n  \"HBA\",\n  \"HBD\",\n  \"#RO5 Violations\", \n  \"QED Weighted\", \n  \"CX LogP\", \n  \"CX LogD\", \n  \"Heavy Atoms\"\n  ])\ndf_0  #1,826,345 mols\n\n\nshape: (1_826_345, 10)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nMax Phase\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\ni64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL539070\"\n0\n73.06\n6\n2\n0\n0.63\n2.57\n2.57\n17\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3335528\"\n0\n269.57\n18\n5\n2\n0.09\n3.31\n-0.14\n60\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2419030\"\n0\n85.13\n6\n1\n0\n0.66\n3.66\n3.66\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3827271\"\n0\n319.06\n10\n11\n2\n0.07\n-6.88\n-8.95\n50\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3465961\"\n0\n50.5\n4\n1\n0\n0.87\n2.13\n-0.44\n23\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2017916\"\n0\n77.0\n6\n1\n0\n0.8\n2.17\n2.1\n22\n\n\n\"CHEMBL374652\"\n0\n36.02\n2\n2\n1\n0.42\n5.36\n5.36\n26\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1416264\"\n0\n85.07\n7\n1\n0\n0.54\n2.47\n2.47\n27\n\n\n\"CHEMBL213734\"\n0\n101.7\n5\n2\n0\n0.5\n2.36\n1.95\n21\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1531634\"\n0\n29.1\n2\n1\n0\n0.67\n4.04\n4.04\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Selecting all max phase 4 molecules with their training features\ndf_4 = df_pa.filter((pl.col(\"Max Phase\") == 4)).select([\n      \"ChEMBL ID\", \n      \"Max Phase\",\n      \"Polar Surface Area\",\n      \"HBA\",\n      \"HBD\",\n      \"#RO5 Violations\", \n      \"QED Weighted\", \n      \"CX LogP\", \n      \"CX LogD\", \n      \"Heavy Atoms\"\n      ])\ndf_4  # 2,870 mols\n\n\nshape: (2_870, 10)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nMax Phase\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\ni64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1200675\"\n4\n12.47\n2\n0\n1\n0.31\n6.27\n4.89\n29\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1200436\"\n4\n46.53\n3\n1\n0\n0.7\n2.95\n2.95\n22\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1096882\"\n4\n186.07\n10\n5\n0\n0.31\n-1.97\n-5.12\n24\n\n\n\"CHEMBL256997\"\n4\n76.22\n4\n1\n0\n0.8\n3.92\n0.68\n21\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2023898\"\n4\n174.64\n8\n4\n2\n0.14\n4.18\n4.16\n54\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1619785\"\n4\n128.03\n8\n2\n0\n0.49\n2.09\n1.86\n34\n\n\n\"CHEMBL4297142\"\n4\n0.0\n0\n0\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2364639\"\n4\n74.02\n6\n1\n0\n0.68\n3.65\n2.3\n30\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1232131\"\n4\n94.83\n4\n3\n0\n0.44\n1.2\n-1.18\n12\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3989949\"\n4\n95.92\n6\n1\n0\n0.9\n1.66\n1.66\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_4.describe()\n\n\nshape: (9, 11)\n\n\n\nstatistic\nChEMBL ID\nMax Phase\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\nstr\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\n\n\n\n\n\"count\"\n\"2870\"\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n2870.0\n\n\n\"null_count\"\n\"0\"\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n\"mean\"\nnull\n4.0\n74.951927\n4.574216\n1.780488\n0.340418\n0.54947\n1.966551\n0.841592\n23.863066\n\n\n\"std\"\nnull\n0.0\n53.875964\n3.06589\n1.762048\n0.703626\n0.235063\n2.61846\n3.015392\n11.064927\n\n\n\"min\"\n\"CHEMBL1000\"\n4.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n-10.11\n-17.92\n0.0\n\n\n\"25%\"\nnull\n4.0\n37.61\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.39\n0.34\n-0.63\n17.0\n\n\n\"50%\"\nnull\n4.0\n65.78\n4.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0.58\n2.29\n1.12\n23.0\n\n\n\"75%\"\nnull\n4.0\n100.9\n6.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.74\n3.73\n2.75\n30.0\n\n\n\"max\"\n\"CHEMBL99946\"\n4.0\n359.42\n20.0\n15.0\n4.0\n0.94\n11.62\n11.62\n69.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have to go back to the first post at this point to change the data restriction criteria for the parquet file as I’ve found out in this step above that if I restrict data via inorganic flags, then it’ll remove a lot of compounds with calculated physicochemical properties (because most of the ones in the data are preclinical compounds with inorganic flag of -1 or max phase 0 compounds; inorganic flag of 1 is inorganic ones and 0 should be the non-inorganic ones - I’ve updated its definition above too after re-checking the ChEMBL schema). For now, I’m restricting data via removing compounds with zero targets rather than via the inorganic flag, and this leaves us a set of max phase 4 compounds with their physicochemical properties calculated in ChEMBL (which is needed for training the model in the next post).\n\n\nRe-sampling via under-sampling - dealing with imbalanced dataset\nBecause of the presence of a large number of max phase 0 compounds (1,826,345 molecules) and the relatively smaller number of max phase 4 compounds (2,870 molecules) in the original dataset, I’m going to randomly sample 2800 small molecules from the max phase 0 group to balance out the ratio of max phase 0 versus max phase 4 compounds. This will allow us to have a similar amount of data in each group to avoid a very imbalanced dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor an alternative and likely a better way to deal with imbalanced datasets, please see my later post that attempts to use a “generalized threshold shifting” method.\n\n\n\ndf_0 = df_0.sample(n = 2800, shuffle = True, seed = 0)\ndf_0\n\n\nshape: (2_800, 10)\n\n\n\nChEMBL ID\nMax Phase\nPolar Surface Area\nHBA\nHBD\n#RO5 Violations\nQED Weighted\nCX LogP\nCX LogD\nHeavy Atoms\n\n\nstr\ni64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\n\n\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1420527\"\n0\n66.81\n4\n1\n0\n0.47\n3.94\n3.94\n32\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1878707\"\n0\n62.55\n3\n1\n0\n0.93\n3.38\n3.38\n25\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3971884\"\n0\n73.86\n5\n1\n2\n0.12\n9.34\n9.34\n40\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3438846\"\n0\n84.22\n4\n2\n0\n0.76\n2.01\n-0.19\n26\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1819378\"\n0\n40.46\n4\n0\n0\n0.62\n4.0\n4.0\n26\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\"CHEMBL2145354\"\n0\n84.67\n5\n1\n0\n0.68\n3.51\n3.51\n30\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3926224\"\n0\n87.15\n5\n1\n2\n0.33\n2.51\n2.51\n38\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3448203\"\n0\n86.37\n4\n1\n0\n0.88\n1.7\n1.7\n26\n\n\n\"CHEMBL1478078\"\n0\n37.38\n2\n0\n0\n0.74\n2.9\n2.9\n20\n\n\n\"CHEMBL3105607\"\n0\n64.99\n5\n1\n0\n0.68\n4.15\n4.15\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the plan is to use LR method for the ML model, the y variable I’m interested in is going to be a binary categorical variable - meaning it needs to be 0 (not approved) or 1 (approved).

    "text": "Well, I’ve always had a thought sitting at the back of my mind about working on a chemistry-related data project. It was partly due to the research saga detailed in another blog post. About two months ago, I thought I will never be able to get anything decent (e.g. first-author paper) published out of my PhD, so I was thinking of going down the route of working on health data science, which was where I could tie in my pharmacist background. Miraculously, the paper actually got published last month, which meant I might have more career options now…\nThe funny thing was that before I knew this paper was coming, I’ve already made up my mind about working on at least one piece of chemistry-related work before leaving it behind completely. Therefore, this was how I got myself started on this post, a small piece of cheminformatics work on molecular similarity for selected COVID-19 antivirals, as taking my first baby step in this field.\n\n\n\nThis work was coded entirely in Python3 and saved as .ipynb file initially in Jupyter Notebook. It was later converted into .qmd file via CLI1, which was run without problems in RStudio IDE. One thing to note was that all 2D chemical structures or similarity maps did not physically show up in RStudio IDE after code executions, but after file rendering, all of them appeared accordingly in the published version.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by D koi on Unsplash"

    "text": "Some introductions\nI’ve somehow promised myself to do a tree series on machine learning and glad I’ve made it to the boosted trees part (it took a while…). This is also likely my last post on this topic for now as there are other things I want to explore in the near future. Hopefully this is somewhat useful for anyone who’s new to this.\n\n\nAdaBoost\nAdaptive Boost or AdaBoost has originated from Robert E. Schapire in 1990 (Schapire 1990), (Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili 2022), and was further introduced in 1996 by Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund at a conference which also led to a publication (Freund and Schapire 1997).\nAs quoted from scikit-learn, an AdaBoost algorithm is doing this:\n\n…fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWeak learner means an ensemble of very simple base classifiers such as decision tree stumps (Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili 2022)\n\n\nDuring the process of running the algorithm, increased weights are given to the incorrectly predicted samples at each iteration, and less weights are given to the correctly predicted ones. This then forces the AdaBoost models to focus more on the less accurately predicted samples with the aim to improve ensemble performance. The predictions from these iterations are combined to produce a final prediction via a weighted majority vote style, which is a well-known signature of tree models. Overall, AdaBoost algorithm can be used for classification or regression problems. The main difference between bagging and boosting is that boosting only uses random subsets of training samples drawn from the training dataset without any replacements (Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili 2022). One caveat to note is that AdaBoost tend to overfit training data (high variance).\nParameters to tune:\n\nn_estimators - number of weak learners\nlearning_rate - contributions of weak learners in the final combination\nmax_depth - depth of trees\nmin_samples_split - minimum required number of samples to consider a split\n\n\n\n\nGradient boosted trees\nEssentially a similar concept is behind gradient boosted trees where a series of weak learners is trained in order to create a stronger ensemble of models (Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili 2022). However, some differences between these two types of boosted trees (e.g. AdaBoost and XGBoost) should be noted, and rather than describing them in a paragraph, I’ve summarised them in a table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaBoost\nXGBoost\n\n\n\n\ntrains weak learners based on errors from previous decision tree stump\ntrains weak learners that are deeper than decision tree stumps with a max depth of 3 to 6 (or max number of leaf nodes from 8 to 64)\n\n\nuses prediction errors to calculate sample weights and classifier weights\nuses prediction errors directly to produce the target variable to fit the next tree\n\n\nuses individual weighting terms for each tree\nuses a global learning rate for each tree\n\n\n\nDifferences between XGBoost and AdaBoost (Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili 2022)\n\nXGBoost or extreme gradient boosting (Chen and Guestrin 2016) is one of the most commonly used open-source packages, originally developed at the University of Washington by T. Chen and C. Guestrin, that uses stochastic gradient boosting to build an ensemble of predictive models.\nXGBoost documentation - https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\nMain parameters to tune as suggested by (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020):\n\nsubsample - controls fraction of observations that should be sampled at each iteration or a subsample ratio of the training instance (as per XGBoost’s scikit-learn API). This is similar to how a random forest operates but without the sample replacement part\neta (in XGBoost) or learning_rate (in scikit-learn wrapper interface for XGBoost) - a shrinkage factor applied to alpha (a factor derived from weighted errors) in the boosting algorithm or it simply may be more easily understood as the boosting learning rate used to prevent overfitting\n\nThere are of course a whole bunch of other XGBoost parameters that can be tuned, and in order to keep this post at a reasonable reading length, I won’t go through every single one of them, but see this link as an example parameter set for XGBClassifier().\nIn scikit-learn, there are also two types of gradient boosted tree methods, GradientBoostingClassifer() and HistGradientBoostingClassifier(), in its sklearn.ensemble module (note: equivalent regressor class also available). One way to choose between them is to check sample size first. GradientBoostingClassifer() class is likely better when there is only a small sample size (e.g. when number of sample is less than 10,000), while HistGradientBoostingClassifier() class is likely better when your sample size is at least 10,000+ or more. The HistGradientBoostingClassifier() is a histogram-based gradient boosting classification tree that is mainly inpired by LightGBM.\n\n\n\n\nA demo\nIn the example below, I’m only using AdaBoost classifier and XGBoost classifier for now. Please note that the dataset used here is very small and the example is likely not going to reflect real-life use case completely (use with care).\n\n\nImport libraries\n\nimport sys\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport chembl_downloader\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nimport pickle\n\n# Import Scikit_mol\nimport scikit_mol\n## Check and clean SMILES\nfrom scikit_mol.utilities import CheckSmilesSanitazion\n## Standardise molecules\nfrom scikit_mol.standardizer import Standardizer\n## Import fingerprints & descriptors\nfrom scikit_mol.fingerprints import MorganFingerprintTransformer\nfrom scikit_mol.descriptors import MolecularDescriptorTransformer\n## Import smi2mol transformer\nfrom scikit_mol.conversions import SmilesToMolTransformer\n\n# Import scikit-learn\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n## Data scaler (variance scaling)\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\n\n# Import xgboost classifier\nimport xgboost\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n\nprint(f\"xgboost version used: {xgboost.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"scikit-learn version used: {sklearn.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"rdkit version used: {rdkit.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"scikit_mol version used: {scikit_mol.__version__}\")\n\nxgboost version used: 2.0.3\nscikit-learn version used: 1.5.0\nrdkit version used: 2024.09.4\nscikit_mol version used: 0.4.5\n\n\n\n# Show Python version used \nprint(sys.version)\n\n3.12.7 (main, Oct 16 2024, 09:10:10) [Clang 18.1.8 ]\n\n\n\n\n\nData source\nData source is based on ChEMBL database version 33 (as shown by the file name below, “chembl_d_ache_33”), which was downloaded previously from last post (on random forest classifier) by using chembl_downloader.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Pick any directory, but make sure it's relative to your home directory\ndirectory = Path.home().joinpath(\".data\", \"blog\")\n# Create the directory if it doesn't exist\ndirectory.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\n\n# Create a file path that corresponds to the previously cached ChEMBL data \npath = directory.joinpath(f\"chembl_d_ache_33.tsv\")\n\n# alternative way to download latest ChEMBL version\n# please see post link -

Another useful way to deal with SMILES errors is Molpipeline’s SMILES error handling, with an example shown in one of its notebooks. The main difference from what I can see, even though I haven’t got to use it yet, is that Molpipeline takes into account of all the invalid SMILES by giving each invalid SMILES a “NaN” label in the pipeline process - this maintains the matrix shape and good for tracking down the problematic SMILES (molecules).\n\nchecksmi = CheckSmilesSanitazion()\n# Checking on SMILES (X) \nX_valid, X_errors =

dataset, but if using HistGradientBoostingClassifier() instead, it should take care of the native NaNs.\n\nprint(f\"{df_ache.canonical_smiles.isna().sum()} out of {len(df_ache)} SMILES failed in conversion\")\n\n0 out of 7075 SMILES failed in conversion\n\n\nThere are other ways to deal with NaNs with a few examples provided by scikit-learn. However, with regards to drug discovery data, there are probably more caveats that need to be taken during data preprocessing (I’m also still exploring this too).\n\n\n\nSplit data\nRandomly splitting data this time.\n\n# Found a silly error when naming X, y train/test sets!\n# Remember to name them in this order: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test\n# otherwise model fitting won't work...\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_valid, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate pipelines\nThe aim is to create pipeline(s) using scikit-learn.\n\n\nAdaBoost classifier\nThe original plan is to chain an AdaBoost classifier, XGBoost classifier, along with Scikit-mol transformers all at once. However, it turns out that I’m building two separate pipelines of AdaBoost classifier and XGBoost classifier so that I can compare the difference(s) between them, and this also serves better for the purpose of this post really.\nThis is also the time to think about generating molecular features for model training. Choosing data features such as fingerprints (e.g. Morgan fingerprints which is usually best for larger dataset) or RDKit 2D descriptors (which is useful for smaller datasets) or others. For RDKit 2D descriptors, Scikit-mol has integrated RDKit’s rdkit.Chem.Descriptors module and rdkit.ML.Descriptors.MoleculeDescriptors module within its MolecularDescriptorTransformer().\nSome useful links regarding building pipelines in scikit-learn and also another reference notebook on when to use parallel calculations for different molecular features:\n\nPipeline module\nmake_pipeline module (simpler pipeline construction, without naming estimators ourselves but rather naming them automatically)\nUseful notebook explaining when is the best to run parallel calculations to calculate molecular fingerprints and descriptors\n\nInitally, RDKit 2D descriptors are used and to see all the available descriptors, run the following code.\n\nrdkit2d = MolecularDescriptorTransformer()\navailable_descriptors = rdkit2d.available_descriptors\nprint(f\"First 10 descriptor names: {available_descriptors[:10]}\")\n\nFirst 10 descriptor names: ['MaxAbsEStateIndex', 'MaxEStateIndex', 'MinAbsEStateIndex', 'MinEStateIndex', 'qed', 'SPS', 'MolWt', 'HeavyAtomMolWt', 'ExactMolWt', 'NumValenceElectrons']\n\n\nFor the first sample pipeline I’m building below, I’ve noticed that not all of the 209 RDKit 2D descriptors can be used for AdaBoost classifier, as some of the descriptors will have values of “0” and AdaBoost classifier will not be able to take care of them. Therefore, I’m only using a small selection of descriptors only, but HistGradientBoostingClassifier() should be able to take into account of NaNs and can be chained to include all descriptors in a pipeline.\nThe following is an example of building a scikit_learn pipeline by using AdaBoost classifier model, along with Scikit-mol’s transformers for multi-class max_phase predictions with training set consisting of molecules with max_phase 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The training data being used here is also very imbalanced with a lot of them being max_phase of “0” than “4”, and with max_phase “4” being our ultimate aim, the dataset used above is really for demonstration only. Also, since this post is already quite long, I’d rather not make this post into a gigantic tl;dr, so for the imbalanced data discussion and exploration, my previous posts have tried to touch on this topic - “Random forest” and “Random forest classifier”.\n\n\n\nHyperparameter tuning for XGBoost classifier\nFor XGBoost, one of the main things is to minimise model overfitting where several parameters will play important roles to achieve this. For example, learning_rate and subsample are the first two mentioned previously, and another technique is based on regularisation which includes two other parameters, reg_alpha (L1 regularisation based on Manhattan distance) and reg_lamda (L2 regularisation based on Euclidean distance). Both of these regularisation parameters aim to penalise XGBoost’s model complexity to make it a bit more conservative in order to reduce overfitting (Bruce, Bruce, and Gedeck 2020).\nA full list of XGBoost classifier pipeline parameters and settings used can be retrieved as shown below. It contains a long list of parameters and one of the ways to find the optimal set of parameters is by using cross-validation (CV).\n\nmlpipe_xgb.get_params()\n\n{'memory': None,\n 'steps':

Here, I’m going to try to look for the best combination of learning_rate and subsample for a XGBoost classifier model for now.\n\n# Specify parameters and distributions to be sampled\nparams_dist = {\n    # learning_rate usually between 0.01 - 0.1 as suggested by Raschka et al. \n    # default is between 0 and 1\n    \"xgbclassifier__learning_rate\": [0.05, 0.1, 0.3], \n    # subsample default is between 0 and 1\n    \"xgbclassifier__subsample\": [0.5, 0.7, 1.0]\n}\n\n\n\n\nRandomised search CV\nThe following chunk of code is an example of running randomised search CV. I’ve deliberately folded the code to minimise the reading length of the post and also because the result from it is very similar to the grid search CV used below (randomised search CV run time was 13 min 33.2 seconds due to having two pipelines containing two different machine learning models for the same set of data). It’s being kept as a code reference for anyone who’d like to try it and also as an alternative way to do hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\nCode\n## Uncomment code below to run\n# from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n# from time import time\n\n## Borrowing a utility function code from scikit_learn documentation to report best scores\n## Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_randomized_search.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-randomized-search-py\n\n# def report(results, n_top=3):\n#     for i in range(1, n_top + 1):\n#         candidates = np.flatnonzero(results[\"rank_test_score\"] == i)\n#         for candidate in candidates:\n#             print(\"Model with rank: {0}\".format(i))\n#             print(\n#                 \"Mean validation score: {0:.3f} (std: {1:.3f})\".format(\n#                     results[\"mean_test_score\"][candidate],\n#                     results[\"std_test_score\"][candidate],\n#                 )\n#             )\n#             print(\"Parameters: {0}\".format(results[\"params\"][candidate]))\n#             print(\"\")\n\n## The following code has also referenced and adapted from this notebook \n## https://github.com/EBjerrum/scikit-mol/blob/main/notebooks/06_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb\n\n# n_iter_search = 9\n\n# random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(\n#     mlpipe_xgb, \n#     param_distributions=params_dist,\n#     n_iter=n_iter_search,\n#     n_jobs=2\n# )\n\n# t_start = time()\n# random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n# t_finish = time()\n\n# print(f'Runtime: {t_finish-t_start:0.2F} seconds for {n_iter_search} iterations')\n\n## Run report function code\n# report(random_search.cv_results_)\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid search CV\n\n# grid_search = GridSearchCV(\n#     mlpipe_xgb,\n#     param_grid=params_dist,\n#     verbose=1,\n#     n_jobs=2\n# )\n\n# grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# print(f\"The best cv score is: {grid_search.best_score_:0.2f}\")\n# print(f\"The best cv parameter settings are: {grid_search.best_params_}\")\n\n## This may take longer time to run depending on computer hardware specs (for me it's taken ~13min)\n\n\n\n\nAn example of code output from running the grid search code\n\n\nFor tuning parameters of Morgan fingerprints, this Scikit-mol example notebook explains how to do it with code, so I won’t repeat them here, but have only shown how to tune some of the main XGBoost parameters.\n\n\n\nPickle model\nThe next step is to pickle the model or pipeline if wanting to save it for future use and to avoid re-training model from the ground up again.\nSome security tips regarding pickle module:\n\nPython documentation\nReference blog post 1 and blog post 2\n\nOne thing to remember is to avoid unpickling unknown files over insecure network, and add security key if needed.\n\n# Pickle to save (serialise) the model in working directory (specify path if needed)\n# \"wb\" - write binary\npickle.dump(mlpipe_xgb, open(\"xgb_pipeline.pkl\", \"wb\"))\n# Unpickle (de-serialise) the model\n# \"rb\" - read binary\nmlpipe_xgb_2 = pickle.load(open(\"xgb_pipeline.pkl\", \"rb\"))\n\n# Use the unpickled model object to make prediction\npred2 = mlpipe_xgb_2.predict(X_test)\n\n## Check unpickled model and original model are the same via Python's assertion method\n#assert np.sum(np.abs(pred2 - pred)) == 0\n## or alternatively use numpy's allclose()\nprint(np.allclose(pred, pred2))\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nAgain, this grows into another really long post… Although this post has taken quite a long time to build up to completion, I still want to thank all the contributors or developers for all the packages used in this post.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBjerrum, EJ, RA Bachorz, A Bitton, O Choung, Y Chen, C Esposito, SV Ha, and A Poehlmann. 2023. “Scikit-Mol Brings Cheminformatics to Scikit-Learn.” https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60ef0fc58825826143a82cc0.\n\n\nBruce, Peter, Andrew Bruce, and Peter Gedeck. 2020.

It seemed that traditional ML methods were still indispensible performance-wise, and when used in combination with deep learning neural networks, they tend to increase prediction accuracy more. I also haven’t ventured into the practicality and usefulness of large language models in drug discovery yet, but I’m aware work in this area has been started. However, comments from experienced seniors did mention that they are still very much novel and therefore may not be as useful yet. Although by the speed of how things evolve in the so-called “AI” field, this possibly may change very soon. Also from what I can imagine, molecular representations in texts or strings are not quite the same as natural human language texts, since there are a lot of other chemistry-specific features to consider, e.g. chiralities, aromaticities and so on. Because of this, I’m sticking with learning to walk first by trying to cover conventional ML methods in a more thorough way, before trying to run in the deep learning zone.\nSo this leads to this series of posts (3 in total) about decision tree. Previously, I’ve only lightly touched on a commonly used classifier algorithm, logistic regression, as the first series in the ML realm. Reflecting back, I think I could’ve done a more thorough job during the data preparation stage. So this would be attempted this time. The data preparation used here was carried out with strong reference to the materials and methods section in this paper (Tilborg, Alenicheva, and Grisoni 2022), which was one of the papers I’ve read. There are probably other useful methods out there, but this paper made sense to me, so I’ve adopted a few of their ways of doing things during data preprocessing.\n\n\n\nData retrieval\nThis time I decided to try something new which was to use the ChEMBL web resource client to collect data (i.e. not by direct file downloads from ChEMBL website, although other useful way could be through SQL queries, which is also on my list to try later). I found this great online resource about fetching data this way from the TeachOpenCADD talktorial on compound data acquisition. The data retrieval workflow used below was mainly adapted from this talktorial with a few changes to suit the selected dataset and ML model.\nThe web resource client was supported by the ChEMBL group and was based on a Django QuerySet interface. Their GitHub repository might explain a bit more about it, particularly the Jupyter notebook link provided in the repository would help a lot regarding how to write code to search for specific data.\nTo do this, a few libraries needed to be loaded first.\n\n# Import libraries\n# Fetch data through ChEMBL web resource client\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\n# Dataframe library\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Progress bar\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nTo see what types of data were provided by ChEMBL web resource client, run the following code and refer to ChEMBL documentations to find out what data were embedded inside different data categories. Sometimes, it might not be that straight forward and some digging would be required (I went back to this step below to find the “data_validity_comment” when I was trying to do some compound sanitisations actually).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe link provided above also talked about other useful techniques for data checks in the ChEMBL database - a very important step to do during data preprocessing, which was also something I was trying to cover and achieve as much as possible in this post.\n\n\n\navailable_resources = [resource for resource in dir(new_client) if not resource.startswith('_')]\nprint(available_resources)\n\n['activity', 'activity_supplementary_data_by_activity', 'assay', 'assay_class', 'atc_class', 'binding_site', 'biotherapeutic', 'cell_line', 'chembl_id_lookup', 'compound_record', 'compound_structural_alert', 'description', 'document', 'document_similarity', 'drug', 'drug_indication', 'drug_warning', 'go_slim', 'image', 'mechanism', 'metabolism', 'molecule', 'molecule_form', 'official', 'organism', 'protein_classification', 'similarity', 'source', 'substructure', 'target', 'target_component', 'target_relation', 'tissue', 'xref_source']\n\n\nResource objects were created to enable API access as suggested by the talktorial.\n\n# for targets (proteins)\ntargets_api = new_client.target\n\n# for bioactivities\nbioact_api = new_client.activity\n\n# for assays\nassay_api = new_client.assay\n\n# for compounds\ncpd_api = new_client.molecule\n\nChecked object type for one of these API objects (e.g. bioactivity API object).\n\ntype(bioact_api)\n\nchembl_webresource_client.query_set.QuerySet\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching target data\nA protein target e.g. acetylcholinesterase was randomly chosen by using UniProt to look up the protein UniProt ID.\n\n# Specify Uniprot ID for acetylcholinesterase\nuniprot_id = \"P22303\"\n\n# Get info from ChEMBL about this protein target, \n# with selected features only\ntargets = targets_api.get(target_components__accession = uniprot_id).only(\n    \"target_chembl_id\",\n    \"organism\", \n    \"pref_name\", \n    \"target_type\"\n)\n\nThe query results were stored in a “targets” object, which was a QuerySet with lazy data evaluation only, meaning it would only react when there was a request for the data. Therefore, to see the results, the “targets” object was then read through Pandas DataFrame.\n\n# Read \"targets\" with Pandas\ntargets = pd.DataFrame.from_records(targets)\ntargets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norganism\npref_name\ntarget_chembl_id\ntarget_type\n\n\n\n\n0\nHomo sapiens\nAcetylcholinesterase\nCHEMBL220\nSINGLE PROTEIN\n\n\n1\nHomo sapiens\nAcetylcholinesterase\nCHEMBL220\nSINGLE PROTEIN\n\n\n2\nHomo sapiens\nCholinesterases; ACHE & BCHE\nCHEMBL2095233\nSELECTIVITY GROUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected the first protein target from this dataframe.\n\n# Save the first protein in the dataframe\nselect_target = targets.iloc[0]\nselect_target\n\norganism                    Homo sapiens\npref_name           Acetylcholinesterase\ntarget_chembl_id               CHEMBL220\ntarget_type               SINGLE PROTEIN\nName: 0, dtype: object\n\n\nThen saved the selected ChEMBL ID for the first protein (to be used later).\n\nchembl_id = select_target.target_chembl_id\n# Check it's saved\nprint(chembl_id)\n\nCHEMBL220\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching bioactivity data\nObtaining bioactivity data for the selected target.\n\nbioact = bioact_api.filter(\n    # Use the previously saved target ChEMBL ID\n    target_chembl_id = chembl_id, \n    # Selecting for Ki\n    standard_type = \"Ki\",\n    # Requesting exact measurements\n    relation = \"=\",\n    # Binding data as \"B\"\n    assay_type = \"B\",\n).only(\n    \"activity_id\",\n    \"data_validity_comment\"\n    \"assay_chembl_id\",\n    \"assay_description\",\n    \"assay_type\",\n    \"molecule_chembl_id\",\n    \"standard_units\",\n    \"standard_type\",\n    \"relation\",\n    \"standard_value\",\n    \"target_chembl_id\",\n    \"target_organism\"\n)\n\n# Check the length and type of bioactivities object\nprint(len(bioact), type(bioact))\n\n706 &lt;class 'chembl_webresource_client.query_set.QuerySet'&gt;\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the data being held inside each entry of the bioactivity dataset, e.g. for first entry.\n\nprint(len(bioact[0]), type(bioact[0]))\nbioact[0]\n\n15 &lt;class 'dict'&gt;\n\n\n{'activity_id': 111024,\n 'assay_chembl_id': 'CHEMBL641011',\n 'assay_description': 'Inhibition constant determined against Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) receptor.',\n 'assay_type': 'B',\n 'data_validity_comment': 'Potential transcription error',\n 'molecule_chembl_id': 'CHEMBL11805',\n 'relation': '=',\n 'standard_type': 'Ki',\n 'standard_units': 'nM',\n 'standard_value': '0.104',\n 'target_chembl_id': 'CHEMBL220',\n 'target_organism': 'Homo sapiens',\n 'type': 'Ki',\n 'units': 'nM',\n 'value': '0.104'}\n\n\nThe next step might take a few minutes - downloading the QuerySet as a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nbioact_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(bioact)\n\nbioact_df.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivity_id\nassay_chembl_id\nassay_description\nassay_type\ndata_validity_comment\nmolecule_chembl_id\nrelation\nstandard_type\nstandard_units\nstandard_value\ntarget_chembl_id\ntarget_organism\ntype\nunits\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\n111024\nCHEMBL641011\nInhibition constant determined against Acetylc...\nB\nPotential transcription error\nCHEMBL11805\n=\nKi\nnM\n0.104\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\nKi\nnM\n0.104\n\n\n1\n118575\nCHEMBL641012\nInhibitory activity against human AChE\nB\nNone\nCHEMBL208599\n=\nKi\nnM\n0.026\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\nKi\nnM\n0.026\n\n\n2\n125075\nCHEMBL641011\nInhibition constant determined against Acetylc...\nB\nNone\nCHEMBL60745\n=\nKi\nnM\n1.63\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\nKi\nnM\n1.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecked total rows and columns in the bioactivities dataframe.\n\nbioact_df.shape\n\n(706, 15)\n\n\n\n\nPreprocess bioactivity data\nWhen I reached the second half of data preprocessing, an alarm bell went off regarding using half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in ChEMBL. I remembered reading recent blog posts by Greg Landrum about using IC50 and inhibition constant (Ki) values from ChEMBL. A useful open-access paper (Kalliokoski et al. 2013) from 2013 also looked into this issue about using mixed IC50 data in ChEMBL, and provided a thorough overview about how to deal with situations like this. There was also another paper (Kramer et al. 2012) on mixed Ki data from the same author group in 2012 that touched on similar issues.\nTo summarise both the paper about IC50 and blog posts mentioned above:\n\nit would be the best to check the details of assays used to test the compounds to ensure they were aligned and not extremely heterogeneous, since IC50 values were very assay-specific, and knowing that these values were extracted from different papers from different labs all over the world, mixing them without knowing was definitely not a good idea\nthe slightly better news was that it was more likely okay to combine Ki values for the same protein target from ChEMBL as they were found to be adding less noise to the data (however ideally similar data caution should also apply)\nit was also possible to mix Ki values with IC50 values, but the data would need to be corrected via using a conversion factor of 2.0 to convert Ki values to IC50 values (note: I also wondered if this needed to be re-looked again since this paper was published 10 years ago…)\n\nBecause of this, I decided to stick with Ki values only for now before adding more complexities as I wasn’t entirely confident about mixing IC50 values with Ki values yet. Firstly, I checked for all types of units being used in bioact_df.

Also, “type” column was dropped as there were already a “standard_type” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDifferences between “type” and “standard_type” columns were mentioned by this ChEMBL blog post.\n\n\n\nbioact_df.drop([\"units\", \"value\", \"type\"], axis = 1, inplace = True)\n# Re-check df\nbioact_df.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivity_id\nassay_chembl_id\nassay_description\nassay_type\ndata_validity_comment\nmolecule_chembl_id\nrelation\nstandard_type\nstandard_units\nstandard_value\ntarget_chembl_id\ntarget_organism\n\n\n\n\n0\n111024\nCHEMBL641011\nInhibition constant determined against Acetylc...\nB\nPotential transcription error\nCHEMBL11805\n=\nKi\nnM\n0.104\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\n\n\n1\n118575\nCHEMBL641012\nInhibitory activity against human AChE\nB\nNone\nCHEMBL208599\n=\nKi\nnM\n0.026\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\n\n\n2\n125075\nCHEMBL641011\nInhibition constant determined against Acetylc...\nB\nNone\nCHEMBL60745\n=\nKi\nnM\n1.63\nCHEMBL220\nHomo sapiens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbioact_df.dtypes\n\nactivity_id               int64\nassay_chembl_id          object\nassay_description        object\nassay_type               object\ndata_validity_comment    object\nmolecule_chembl_id       object\nrelation                 object\nstandard_type            object\nstandard_units           object\nstandard_value           object\ntarget_chembl_id         object\ntarget_organism          object\ndtype: object\n\n\nThe column of “standard_value” was converted from “object” to “float64” so we could use the Ki values for calculations later.\n\nbioact_df = bioact_df.astype({\"standard_value\": \"float64\"})\n# Check column data types again\nbioact_df.dtypes\n\nactivity_id                int64\nassay_chembl_id           object\nassay_description         object\nassay_type                object\ndata_validity_comment     object\nmolecule_chembl_id        object\nrelation                  object\nstandard_type             object\nstandard_units            object\nstandard_value           float64\ntarget_chembl_id          object\ntarget_organism           object\ndtype: object\n\n\nThen the next step was taking care of any missing entries by removing them in the first place. I excluded “data_validity_comment” column here as this was required to check if there were any unusual activity data e.g. excessively low or high Ki values.

The details of all the steps taken to reach the final .csv file could be seen in these earlier posts - post 1 and post 2 (yes, it took quite a while to clean the data, so it was splitted into two posts).\n\nThe final .csv file used to train the model was named, “ache_2d_chembl.csv”\nThe earlier version without any RDKit 2D descriptors calculated was named, “ache_chembl.csv”\nBoth files should be in a GitHub repository called, “ML2-1_decision_tree” or in my blog repository, under “posts” folder (look for “16_ML2-1_Decision_tree” folder)\n\n\n\n\nEstimate experimental errors\nThis part was about estimating the impact of experimental errors (pKi values) on the predictive machine learning (ML) models. It was also needed to estimate the maximum possible correlation that could be drawn from the dataset prepared from the previous two posts. I supposed it made more sense if this was done prior to building the ML model, so this wouldn’t be forgotten or missed, as we know that real-life is full of many imperfections.\nThis subsection was inspired by Pat Walters’ posts, which have discussed about estimating errors for experimental data with code links available in these posts:\n\nHow Good Could (Should) My Models Be? - a reference paper (Brown, Muchmore, and Hajduk 2009) was mentioned as the simulation basis for estimating the impact of experimental errors on the correlation from a predictive ML model\nGetting Real with Molecular Property Prediction (under subsection of “How Well Should We Be Able to Model the Data?”)\n\nTo get started, all the required libraries were loaded as below.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import tree\n\nImported the preprocessed data from previous posts.\n\n# Import data\ndtree = pd.read_csv(\"ache_2d_chembl.csv\")\ndtree.drop(columns = [\"Unnamed: 0\"], inplace=True)\ndtree.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\npKi\nmax_phase\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n8.787812\nNaN\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n10.585027\nNaN\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL95\n6.821023\n4.0\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\nCHEMBL173309\n7.913640\nNaN\n694.539707\n0.666667\n8\n0\n2\n8\n50\n...\n2.803680\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\nCHEMBL1128\n6.698970\n4.0\n201.092042\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 25 columns\n\n\n\nThe pKi column was used in the code below as it contained the experimental values (calculated from measured Ki values, usually derived from countless lab experiments) collected from different scientific literatures or other sources as stated in ChEMBL. The aim was to simulate pKi values with experimental errors added to them.\nCode used for the rest of the subsection were adapted with thanks from Pat Walters’ “maximum_correlation.ipynb” with my own added comments for further explanations\n\n# Save exp data (pKi) as an object\ndata = dtree[\"pKi\"]\n# Save the object as a list\ndata_ls = [data]\n\n# Trial 3-, 5- & 10-fold errors\nfor fold in (3, 5, 10):\n    # Retrieve error samples randomly from a normal distribution\n    # Bewteen 0 and log10 of number-fold \n    # for the length of provided data only\n    error = np.random.normal(0, np.log10(fold), len(data))\n    data_ls.append(error + data)\n\n# Convert data_ls to dataframe\ndtree_err = pd.DataFrame(data_ls)\n# Re-align dataframe (switch column header & index)\ndtree_err = dtree_err.transpose()\n# Rename columns\ndtree_err.columns = [\"pKi\", \"3-fold\", \"5-fold\", \"10-fold\"]\nprint(dtree_err.shape)\ndtree_err.head()\n\n(481, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npKi\n3-fold\n5-fold\n10-fold\n\n\n\n\n0\n8.787812\n8.710912\n9.101193\n7.471251\n\n\n1\n10.585027\n10.883334\n10.291557\n9.455301\n\n\n2\n6.821023\n6.134753\n6.799967\n7.122006\n\n\n3\n7.913640\n8.390146\n7.874722\n7.209130\n\n\n4\n6.698970\n7.359148\n7.290723\n5.770489\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelting the created dtree_err so it could be plotted later (noticed there should be an increased number of rows after re-stacking the data).\n\n# Melt the dtree_err dataframe \n# to make error values in one column (for plotting)\ndtree_err_melt = dtree_err.melt(id_vars = \"pKi\")\nprint(dtree_err_melt.shape)\ndtree_err_melt.head()\n\n(1443, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npKi\nvariable\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\n8.787812\n3-fold\n8.710912\n\n\n1\n10.585027\n3-fold\n10.883334\n\n\n2\n6.821023\n3-fold\n6.134753\n\n\n3\n7.913640\n3-fold\n8.390146\n\n\n4\n6.698970\n3-fold\n7.359148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresenting this in regression plots.\nNote: There was a matplotlib bug which would always show a tight_layout user warning for FacetGrid plots in seaborn (the lmplot used below). Seaborn was built based on matplotlib so unsurprisingly this occurred (this GitHub issue link might explain it). I have therefore temporarily silenced this user warning for the sake of post publication.\n\n# To silence the tight-layout user warning\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# variable = error-fold e.g. 3-fold\n# value = pKi value plus error\nsns.set_theme(font_scale = 1.5)\nplot = sns.lmplot(\n    x = \"pKi\", \n    y = \"value\", \n    col = \"variable\", \n    data = dtree_err_melt, \n    # alpha = mark’s opacity (low - more transparent)\n    # s = mark size (increase with higher number)\n    scatter_kws = dict(alpha = 0.5, s = 15)\n    )\ntitle_list = [\"3-fold\", \"5-fold\", \"10-fold\"]\nfor i in range(0, 3):\n    plot.axes[0, i].set_ylabel(\"pKi + error\")\n    plot.axes[0, i].set_title(title_list[i])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating the impact of error on the correlation between experimental pKi and also pKi with errors (3-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold). R2 calculated using scikit-learn was introduced in the code below.\n\n# Calculating r2 score (coefficient of determination) \n# based on 1000 trials for each fold\n# note: data = dtree[\"pKi\"]\n\n# Create an empty list for correlation\ncor_ls = []\nfor fold in [3, 5, 10]:\n    # Set up 1000 trials\n    for i in range(0, 1000):\n        error = np.random.normal(0, np.log10(fold), len(data))\n        cor_ls.append([r2_score(data, data + error), f\"{fold}-fold\"])\n\n# Convert cor_ls into dataframe\nerr_df = pd.DataFrame(cor_ls, columns = [\"r2\", \"fold_error\"])\nerr_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr2\nfold_error\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.899830\n3-fold\n\n\n1\n0.890129\n3-fold\n\n\n2\n0.895605\n3-fold\n\n\n3\n0.880796\n3-fold\n\n\n4\n0.887374\n3-fold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the R2 and fold-errors as violin plots.\n\nsns.set_theme(rc = {\"figure.figsize\": (9, 8)}, font_scale = 1.5)\nvplot = sns.violinplot(x = \"fold_error\", y = \"r2\", data = err_df)\nvplot.set(xlabel = \"Fold error\", ylabel = \"R$^2$\")\n\n[Text(0.5, 0, 'Fold error'), Text(0, 0.5, 'R$^2$')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis definitely helped a lot with visualising the estimated errors for the experimental Ki values curated in ChEMBL for this specific protein target (CHEMBL220, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)). The larger the error-fold, the lower the R2, and once the experimental error reached 10-fold, we could see an estimated R2 (maximum correlation) with its median sitting below 0.55, indicating a likely poor predictive ML model if it was built based on these data with the estimated 10-fold experimental errors.\n\n\n\nCheck max phase distribution\nAt this stage, I’ve planned to do model training on compounds with max phase 4 (i.e. prescription medicines), so this would somewhat be an attempt to mirror real-life scenarios for the ML prediction model.\nMax phases were assigned to each ChEMBL-curated compound according to this ChEMBL FAQ link (under the question of “What is max phase?”). As quoted from this ChEMBL FAQ link, a max phase 4 compound means:\n\n“Approved (4): A marketed drug e.g. AMINOPHYLLINE (CHEMBL1370561) is an FDA approved drug for treatment of asthma.”\n\nChecking out the actual counts of each max phase group in the dataset.\n\ndtree[[\"molecule_chembl_id\", \"max_phase\"]].groupby(\"max_phase\").count()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\n\n\nmax_phase\n\n\n\n\n\n-1.0\n2\n\n\n2.0\n2\n\n\n3.0\n1\n\n\n4.0\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was only a very small number of compounds with max phase 4 assigned (a total count of 10, which was also unsurprising since there weren’t many AChE inhibitors used as prescription medications for dementia - some of the well-known examples were donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine).\nFilling in actual “null” labels for all “NaN” rows in the “max_phase” columns to help with filtering out these compounds later on.\n\ndtree[\"max_phase\"].fillna(\"null\", inplace=True)\ndtree.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\npKi\nmax_phase\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n8.787812\nnull\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n10.585027\nnull\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL95\n6.821023\n4.0\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\nCHEMBL173309\n7.913640\nnull\n694.539707\n0.666667\n8\n0\n2\n8\n50\n...\n2.803680\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\nCHEMBL1128\n6.698970\n4.0\n201.092042\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 25 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanity check on the dataframe\nThis was just another sanity check for myself on the dtree dataframe - making sure there weren’t any “NaN” cells in it (so dropping any “NaN” again, even though I might have already done this as one of the steps during data preprocessing).\n\ndtree.dropna()\nprint(dtree.shape)\ndtree.head()\n\n(481, 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmolecule_chembl_id\npKi\nmax_phase\nmw\nfsp3\nn_lipinski_hba\nn_lipinski_hbd\nn_rings\nn_hetero_atoms\nn_heavy_atoms\n...\nsas\nn_aliphatic_carbocycles\nn_aliphatic_heterocyles\nn_aliphatic_rings\nn_aromatic_carbocycles\nn_aromatic_heterocyles\nn_aromatic_rings\nn_saturated_carbocycles\nn_saturated_heterocyles\nn_saturated_rings\n\n\n\n\n0\nCHEMBL60745\n8.787812\nnull\n245.041526\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\nCHEMBL208599\n10.585027\nnull\n298.123676\n0.388889\n2\n2\n4\n3\n21\n...\n4.331775\n2\n0\n2\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\nCHEMBL95\n6.821023\n4.0\n198.115698\n0.307692\n2\n2\n3\n2\n15\n...\n2.014719\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\nCHEMBL173309\n7.913640\nnull\n694.539707\n0.666667\n8\n0\n2\n8\n50\n...\n2.803680\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\nCHEMBL1128\n6.698970\n4.0\n201.092042\n0.400000\n2\n1\n1\n3\n13\n...\n3.185866\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 25 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel building\n\nTraining data based on max phase 4 compounds\nSo here I wanted to separate the collected data by splitting the compounds into two groups based on their assigned max phases.

The reason I started with one tree was because it was no point in building a multiple-tree model if one had no clue about how one tree was built. To learn as much as possible, I had to dissect the multiple-tree version first to focus on one tree at a time.\nOne thing I’d like to mention was that rivastigmine was not included in the training dataset because it was actually not a pure AChE inhibitor (as it was also a butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitor), since my focus was purely on AChE at this time, this particular drug was unfortunately excluded. However, I did make sure the other two drugs (donepezil and galantamine) were included in the training dataset. One possible thing to do in the future if I want to improve this was to add BChE as another protein target and perhaps add this as an additional dataset towards the model.\nAs described in the subsection of “Estimate experimental errors”, there were experimental errors of 3-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold estimated based on the provided pKi data. With the prediction model used in this post, the estimated experimental errors would need to be taken into consideration, particularly at the time when the model was being investigated during the model evaluation and validation step (however due to the length of series 2.1 posts, I decided not to add this step yet, but would try to look at this later in the multiple tree model series if this applies).\nA bit about the last decision tree plot, tentatively clogp (calculated partition coefficient) might be the crucial molecular feature in deciding whether a molecule might be closer to being an AChE inhibitor. Other important molecular features also included the number of aromatic rings, molecular weights, solvent accessible surface area and others (I’ve set the random state to 1 for now, so hopefully the result will be reproducible as I realised my old code without it always generated different tree plots, then all of the sudden I remembered that I forgot to set the random state of the estimator, so this was added).\nSince the type of AChE inhibitors was not the focus of this series, I won’t go into details about which value of pKi or Ki would lead to the ideal AChE inhibitor (the well-known Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng and Prusoff 1973) might also lead to many discussions about Ki and IC50 values). This is because there are at least two types of AChE inhibitors available - reversible and irreversible (Colovic et al. 2013). Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine mentioned previously are the commonly known reversible AChE inhibitors. The irreversible type, as the name suggested, is usually used as insecticides or nerve agents. Another reason is that I didn’t go into details checking all of the identities for the 10 max phase 4 compounds used in the training set, as I only really made sure that donepezil and galantamine were included in the 10 molecules. If I were to re-model again purely on reversible AChE inhibitors targeting dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, I think I had to be quite sure of what I was training the model with, i.e. excluding irreversible AChE inhibitors from the training set.\nHowever, if our aim was to only find novel AChE inhibitors in a general manner, one of the ways to check post-model building would be to re-run the dataframe again on compounds with max phase as null, including the molecular feature names to find out which compounds were at the predicted threshold cut-off values to see if their corresponding pKi values (note: these preclinical compounds had Ki values extracted from literature sources etc.) would match the predicted ones. One caveat of this method was that there might be pre-existing experimental errors in all the obtained and recorded Ki values, so this might not confirm that the model was truly a good reflection of the real-life scenario. Therefore, at most, this would probably add a very small value during the model evaluation phase.\nThe best way would be to test all of these compounds in the same experimental set-ups, through same experimental steps, and in the same laboratory to find out their respective Ki (or pKi) values. However, this was most likely not very feasible due to various real-life restrictions (the availability of financial and staffing resources). The most likely outcome might be to choose a selected group of compound candidates with the highest possibilities to proceed in the drug discovery pipeline based on past experimental, ML and clinical experiences, and then test them in the ways mentioned here.\nI also came across a blog post about calculating the prediction intervals of ML prediction models (which mentioned the MAPIE package), but I didn’t quite get time to look into this package yet, and from what I have read in its repository link, it potentially could be quite useful for classification, regression and time-series models.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nI didn’t think a definite conclusion could be drawn here, as this was only purely from one very simple and single decision tree, so I have named this last part as “final words”, as I felt if I didn’t stop here, this post or series of posts could go on forever or as long it could. The main thing here was to fully understand how one single decision tree was constructed based on hopefully reasonable-ish data (still not the best as I could not rule out all the noises from the data), and then to view the tree visually in different styles of plots. It was also important to understand how this was a white-box ML approach with clear features or descriptions shown to trace where the tree would branch off to reach different final outcomes or targets. This series was really a preamble for the multiple-tree models e.g. random forest and boosted trees, as I have bravely planned to do a series of posts on tree models due to my interests in them, so that might take a while, slowly but hopefully surely.\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI’d like to thank all the authors for all the open-source packages used in the series 2.1 posts. I’d also like to thank all the authors of all the blog posts mentioned in this series as well since I’ve learnt a lot from them too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBrown, Scott P., Steven W.

    "title": "Shiny app in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Back story\nIt has been a long while since I’ve used R in my projects. Last year during the time when I bravely embraced the role of rotating curator for @WeAreRLadies on Twitter around end of October, I did mention that I wanted to learn Shiny. I haven’t forgotten about this actually. So as promised, here it is, my first Shiny app in R, which is really a very simple interactive web app about small molecules from ChEMBL database. The URL to reach this app, ShinyAppChembl, is at: https://jhylin.shinyapps.io/ShinyAppChembl/. It shows a selected set of physicochemical properties for the curated small molecules in different max phases in boxplot formats. Note: it may take a few minutes to load the plot when first opening the app.\n\n\n\nThe process\nSince I haven’t been using a lot of R lately, I just wanted to document how I approached this Shiny app framework, as part of my self-directed learning for R that started around mid-2022. The first place I went to was not Google’s Bard or OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as I was trying to preempt a scenario where if both of these options were temporarily down, what would I do to learn a new tool. So I visited the Shiny website first, and literally started from the “Get Started” section there, then tried to read through the lessons provided. I gathered a quick overview about the core components within a Shiny app, which were the user interface, server logic and the call to run or create app in the end, and thought to get started from there.\nOne of the most helpful online books called, “Mastering Shiny” had clarified a few coding issues for me. The reactivity section in the book was very useful as well to help with understanding the interactivity concept in the app. The best and also the hardest thing at this stage after reading some of the information was to actually start coding for the app in RStudio IDE, which I did soon after.\n\n\n\nTrials-and-errors\nInitially, I’ve noticed in the gallery section from the Shiny website that some of the basic Shiny apps had plots produced with R code using S3 method - the type with class ‘formula’, such as boxplot(formula e.g. y ~ group, data, and so on). So I started with this first and ended up with a draft version shown below:\n\n\n\nFirst draft app using S3 method in R code to plot boxplots - screenshot taken by author\n\n\n\nI then tried the ggplot2 version, which I preferred to use. However, I kept on hitting a roadblock repeatedly (as shown in the image below):\n\n\n\nSecond draft app using ggplot2 boxplot format - screenshot taken by author\n\n\nI ended up working through this issue of not being able to display the boxplots properly over at least two days, where I tried to figure out how to change the code so that the boxplots would appear as the output in the app. I actually wrote a plot function code (as shown below) before working on the app.R file, in order to trial plotting the boxplots, making sure that the code worked before using it in the app.R file.\n```{r}\ndfBoxplot &lt;- function(var) {\n  label &lt;- rlang::englue(\"{{var}} vs. Max Phases of small molecules\")\n  \n  chembl %&gt;% \n    select(`Max Phase`, {{ var }}) %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = `Max Phase`, y = {{ var }})) +\n    geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(`Max Phase`, 0.25), \n                     colour = `Max Phase`), \n                 outlier.alpha = 0.2) +\n    labs(title = label)\n}\n```\nOnce I made sure this code worked, I transplanted the code into the server section of the app.R file, however it wasn’t that simple obviously. Through the process of more trials-and-errors, I managed to figure out the code for the plot output in the final version, which was not the same as the function code above, but more like this.\n```{r}\n  output$BPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ \n    \n    ggplot(chembl, aes(`Max Phase`, .data[[input$variable]])) +\n      geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(`Max Phase`, 0.25), \n                       colour = `Max Phase`), outlier.alpha = 0.2) +\n      labs(title = \"Distributions of physicochemical properties against max phases\",\n           caption = \"(based on ChEMBL database version 31)\") +\n      theme_minimal()\n    \n    }, res = 96) %&gt;% bindCache(chembl$`Max Phase`, input$variable)\n```\nI then read about the section on “Tidy evaluation” in the “Mastering Shiny” book, which had thoroughly described the problems I’ve encountered (and which I wished I had actually read this section before and not after hitting the roadblock…). So I’d highly recommend new users to read this section and also the rest of the book if Shiny’s also new to you.\n\n\n\nFinal app\nThe final app now looks like this:\n\n\n\nScreenshot taken by author\n\n\n\n\n\nApp deployment\nAfter I got the app working, I looked into where I could deploy the app, since my main goal was to learn and share my work. At first, I went to the Shiny section on the Quarto website to see if it was possible to deploy the app in Quarto. However, after reading through several questions and answers in relation to Shiny apps and Quarto website, it was obvious that it was still not possible yet to deploy the app in an interactive way on Quarto websites (but it was mentioned in Posit community that this was being looked into, so I’m looking forward to the day when we can do exactly that in the future). This means that currently, there will only be an app image showing up in a Quarto document at most. I ended up choosing shinyapp.io to deploy my first Shiny app for now.\n\n\n\nAbout the boxplots\nSince the main goal of this post is more on the process of producing a simple Shiny app for a new comer, I won’t go into the fine details to describe how these boxplots differ between different max phases. Also as a side note, I’m aware that some experts in data visualisations might not really like boxplots in general, but for my case, I’ve got molecules in different max phases where a boxplot is presented for each max phase lining up next to each other. Therefore, in a way, some relative comparisons or differences could be drawn visually in the first glance, although other graph types such as density plots or heat maps might be better options.\nI’ll focus on the “QED Weighted” variable here, as it’s a physicochemical property that has combined several molecular features together as a score (please refer to this post - section: “Some exploratory data analysis” for details about this QED weighted score). For all the boxplots shown when “QED Weighted” is selected from the drop-down box, max phase 4 molecules obviously have higher QED weighted scores in general than all of the other max phases. This is especially clear when comparing the medians between them, with max phase 4 small molecules having a median QED weighted score of more than 0.5, and the rest of the other max phases had 0.5 or below. The higher the QED weighted scores, the more druglike the molecules will be, and for max phase 4 molecules, they are mostly prescription medicines that have already reached approval and are already being widely prescribed. So this makes sense as this is being reflected in the boxplots for these ChEMBL small molecules.\n\n\n\nFinal words\nFinally, I’m quite pleasantly surprised that there is also a Shiny in Python version, which has a Shinylive option to deploy Shiny app interactively in GitHub Gist and so on… I’ll most likely need to read further into this and make this as my next project. This is also a nice break from my recent machine learning projects, which I’ll try to return to once I’ve had enough fun with Shiny!\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Using R in Python - rpy2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is something I’ve always wanted to try, that is using both R and Python in one place, so here it is.\nEssentially, I think there are two packages that may do the trick - one is rpy2 and the other is reticulate. I’ll try rpy2 first in this post. For the notes about using reticulate package, it’ll be in a separate post (add link).\nThere will be two different versions of code below where one is based on using R dataframe in Python and ggplot2, and the other one is based on pandas dataframe in Python with ggplot2. From my little experience using both versions of code, I’d say the second one using pandas and ggplot2 works better than the first (other more experienced users may have different opinions of course… there are always new things to learn for sure).\n\n\nSetting up notebook environment\nSteps:\nThis notebook has been created using a virtual environment using uv, with the associated repository created using the project structure from uv too. This step has been done prior to the executions of the following steps.\n\nInstall R with version at least 4.0 or above, and Python with version at least 3.7 or above (as suggested by this post). The versions of Python and R used in this notebook are printed above the plot shown below.\nInstall R’s language server as shown below.\n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"languageserver\")\n```\n\nInstall reticulate package (GitHub repo). It’s a useful R interface to Python and will be used in the other post.\nInstall rmarkdown package (may not be required as this is really just making sure that this note may be posted on my blog later that uses Quarto).\nInstall R extension for VS Code (may not be required as this is because I’m using VS Code. There is another very similar IDE called Positron created by Posit which may not require this step).\nInstall rpy2 package. This notebook uses rpy2 version 3.6.4.\n\nNote: the installations of R-related packages need to be done in the R console in RStudio/Positron IDE or R terminal in VS Code. The R code above are not to be executed in Quarto markdown (.qmd) or RMarkdown (.rmd) documents as this will lead to an error message like this, “trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror…” when trying to preview the .qmd or .rmd.\n\n\n\nUsing R dataframe in python and ggplot2\n\nimport rpy2\n#import rpy2 as robjects\n## To print HTML in notebooks\n# import rpy2.ipython.html\n# rpy2.ipython.html.init_printing()\n\nfrom rpy2.robjects.packages import importr\n\n# Using a local converter\nfrom rpy2.robjects import conversion, default_converter\nwith conversion.localconverter(default_converter):\n\n    utils = importr('utils')\n    dataf = utils.read_csv(\"df_ml.csv\")\n    \n    #print(dataf)\n    print(dataf.colnames)\n\n    ## Visualising with ggplot2 in Python\n    import rpy2.robjects.lib.ggplot2 as gp\n\n    p = (gp.ggplot(dataf, gp.aes(x='Polar.Surface.Area', y='QED.Weighted')) + \n        # gp.aes(x='Polar.Surface.Area', y='QED.Weighted') + \n        gp.geom_point())\n\n    ## To see plots in an output cell - this doesn't work yet, it generates an empty .png with error message\n    from rpy2.ipython.ggplot import image_png\n    image_png(p)\n\n    ## this code seems to work by completing the run, but no plot is shown\n    # p.plot()\n\n    ## this code also seems to work but with no plot shown\n    # print(p)\n\nR callback write-console: In addition:   \nR callback write-console: Warning message:\n  \nR callback write-console: In (function (filename = \"Rplot%03d.png\", width = 480, height = 480,  :  \nR callback write-console: \n   \nR callback write-console:  failed to load cairo DLL\n  \n\n\n[1] \"Max_Phase\"          \"Polar.Surface.Area\" \"HBA\"               \n[4] \"HBD\"                \"X.RO5.Violations\"   \"QED.Weighted\"      \n[7] \"CX.LogP\"            \"CX.LogD\"            \"Heavy.Atoms\"       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding issues\nThe first coding issue encountered is that the code to produce a final output of the dataframe won’t transform into a .qmd preview i.e. html page. There is an error message showing such as, “Conversion rules for rpy2.robjects appear to be missing…” when trying to preview this as a .qmd. One of the solutions I’ve found online (code reference) is to set up a local converter in the code and run all rpy2-related code within this converter (as commented in the code above).\nThe second issue is that I’ve only managed to run the code to show R dataframe in Python but not the plot… hence you will see the error message generated from the code above, with only the column names shown without a plot there. To resolve this issue, more time is spent on looking for answers online. A mini test has been done in a Jupyter notebook to show a short code to achieve a simple plot (link to Jupyter notebook which is based on this code reference) by calling R magic in Python kernel via rpy2. Once this works, I then manage to change the code to import a sample dataframe and set up to display a simple scatter plot as shown below.\n\n\n\nUsing pandas and ggplot2\n\n# python version used\nimport sys\nprint(sys.version)\n\n3.12.7 (main, Oct 16 2024, 09:10:10) [Clang 18.1.8 ]\n\n\n\n# Load R magic\n%load_ext rpy2.ipython\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"df_ml.csv\")\ndf = df.rename(columns={\"QED Weighted\": \"QED\", \"Polar Surface Area\": \"PSA\"})\ndf.head()\n\nThe rpy2.ipython extension is already loaded.

I’m open to use either whenever it suits really. As far as I’m aware, R has dyplr package (part of the core tidyverse packages) that is equivalent to pandas in Python (depending on personal preference and habits, different users will have different opinions about “equivalence” here). There is Polars as well that’s available to use in Python and R (R Polars). I think there’s also a more conventional base R code available that can be used to wrangle dataframes (e.g. a R package called data.table that is based on base R’s data.frame, it appears that it may be harder to learn than dyplr due to syntax but it’ll be great for large datasets). There is a useful post suggested by R users online that introduces and explains data.table’s differences from dyplr.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThe main goal here is to try using Python and R concurrently in a notebook setting. Both programming languages have their weaknesses and strengths, and also differences and similarities. By combining them together, we can leverage R’s strong statistical packages and Python’s well-developed and maintained machine learning packages in some of our scientific research work.\nFor rpy2 package, I’ve tried it in a separate post (add link). Interestingly, I had to pause in the middle of working on it due to an issue about plotting. I’ve since returned to it after trying out reticulate, and have found a way to generate a plot using ggplot2 in rpy2.\nFor reticulate package, the concept is reversed where we are trying to call Python in a R environment as it is a R-based package. So I’ve changed the title of this post to reflect this.\n\n\n\nSetting up notebook environment\nSteps I’ve taken:\nInitial preparation - this notebook has been created using a virtual environment from uv, with the associated repository created using the uv project management structure as well. This step has been done prior to the executions of the following steps.\n\nInstall R with version at least 4.0 or above, and Python with version at least 3.7 or above (reference). The versions of R and Python used here are suggested by the old reference post about using rpy2 from 2022. So far when I’ve tried it with reticulate package, it works so I’ll leave them as how they are now.\nInstall R’s language server. All R packages are to be installed via R console/terminal (not in notebooks, otherwise you may run into some error messages).\n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"languageserver\")\n```\n\nInstall reticulate package as shown in its GitHub repository.\nInstall rmarkdown package so we can preview .qmd docs (this step may not be required as this is purely for posting on my blog). Some further set-ups may be required if using VS Code, e.g. go to “Settings” of VS Code -&gt; under “User” -&gt; Text Editor -&gt; Files -&gt; Associations -&gt; add *.Rmd as “Item” and rmd as “Value”\nInstall R extension for VS Code (may not be required as this is because I’m using VS Code. There is another very similar IDE called Positron created by Posit which may not require this step).\nInstall shiny package (I was reminded to do this while installing these packages… unsure of its direct relevance to my goal here but it doesn’t hurt so I’ve done it)\n\nQuarto markdown documents (.qmd) and R markdown documents (.rmd) are interchangeable as .qmd are based on .rmd so I’ve done a little trial using reticulate package first in .rmd which worked, and then decided to switch to .qmd so that this piece of work may be published on my blog later. The convenient thing here is that you can literally just change the file name ending with .rmd to .qmd to convert a .rmd file into a .qmd file.\n\n\n\nImport libraries\n\n# Show R version used\nR.version.string\n\n[1] \"R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13)\"\n\n\n\n# Import R packages/libraries in R\nlibrary(reticulate)\n\n# Import Python packages/libraries in R \n# This step is required to install Python packages in R while using reticulate\n# Reference: https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html\n\n# Import pandas\npy_require(\"pandas\")\n# below likely needed if calling pandas in r code, but since I'll be using python code, \n# we can just import python packages as usual without following code\n#pd &lt;- import(\"pandas\")\n\n# Import plotnine\npy_require( \"plotnine\")\n#p9 &lt;- import(\"plotnine\")\n\n\n# Show Python version used\npy_config()\n\npython:         /Users/jenniferlin/Data_in_life_blog/.venv/bin/python\nlibpython:      /Users/jenniferlin/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.7-macos-x86_64-none/lib/libpython3.12.dylib\npythonhome:     /Users/jenniferlin/Data_in_life_blog/.venv:/Users/jenniferlin/Data_in_life_blog/.venv\nvirtualenv:     /Users/jenniferlin/Data_in_life_blog/.venv/bin/activate_this.py\nversion:        3.12.7 (main, Oct 16 2024, 09:10:10) [Clang 18.1.8 ]\nnumpy:          /Users/jenniferlin/Data_in_life_blog/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/numpy\nnumpy_version:  1.26.4\n\nNOTE: Python version was forced by VIRTUAL_ENV\n\n\nBelow is a small test snippet of running Python code in R.\n\n# Code snippet below borrowed from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-language/integrating-python-code-with-r/\n# Running Python code in R\npy_run_string(\"x = 10\")\npy_run_string(\"y = 5\")\npy_run_string(\"z = x + y\")\n\n# Access the Python variable in R\nz &lt;- py$z  \nprint(z)\n\n[1] 15\n\n\nI have a feeling now that it’s easier to use reticulate package for the purpose of combining Python and R in one place.\n\n\n\nPlotting in R using ggplot2 and plotnine\nNext example is using Python code to read a dataframe using Pandas.\n```{python}\n## This is the code for read_df.py\n# import pandas\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef reading_df(file):\n    # Reading a df (using one of my old cleaned datasets from a while ago)\n    df = pd.read_csv(file)\n    df = df.rename(columns={\"QED Weighted\": \"QED\", \"Polar Surface Area\": \"PSA\"})\n    \n    return df\n```\n\n\nggplot2\nThen I’m using R’s well-known plotting package, ggplot2, to plot a scatter plot as an example shown below.\n\n# Read data using read_df.py\nsource_python(\"read_df.py\")\ndf &lt;- reading_df(\"df_ml.csv\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df, aes(PSA, QED, colour = Max_Phase)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplotnine\nAn equivalent Python plotting library based on ggplot2 is plotnine. The same plot is shown below using plotnine with Python code.\n\nfrom read_df import reading_df\ndf_data = reading_df(\"df_ml.csv\")\n\nimport plotnine as p9\n# from plotnine import *\n# from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_point\n\nplot = (p9.ggplot(data=df_data) + p9.geom_point(mapping=p9.aes(\"PSA\", \"QED\", color = \"Max_Phase\")))\n\nplot.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll plots shown in this post using reticulate and the other post using rpy2 should look the same by using the same set of data but different code in two different programming languages (which means I’ve somewhat achieved my small goal here!).\n\n\n\n\nRegarding reproducibility of projects in R\nI realise after finishing these two posts about using R and Python together that I should’ve created two separate repositories and virtual environments where one is based on Python and the other based on R to improve the reproducibilities of the work (hmm… currently it may look messy with what I’ve done here, as these two posts are in a Python-based virtual environment). It is possible and most likely recommended to set up a R virtual environment when working on R-related projects. This introductory post about renv will help with this.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
